This series is horrible beyond all conception.  Tolkien overbloats EVERYTHING to the point where it\'s absolutely ridiculous, and I loose tract of the plot amidst unimportant details.  Quite frankly my only thought is I DON\'T CARE WHO EVERYONE\'S FATHER IS, IF YOU WANT ME TO KNOW THEN WRITE A PREQUEL, JUST TELL THE STORY IT IDIOTIC BRIT!  I don\'t know how someone who wrote something as good as "The Hobbit" could produce this junk.  I think what happened was he had a bunch of notes left over, and wanted to cash in by writing a sequel, so he threw all the details he had onto a shallow plot, but sense it was to complicated to be called "dumbed-down" like most money-making sequels noone could attack it.  And it was so complicated people have been trying to convince others for decades that they\'re intellegent because they can understand this book, but since noone understands it, noone can test them to see if they really do or not.  Anyway, if you want a complicated plot you can understand, read "Dune" by Frank Herbert.
