This review compares the new 3 book hardcover box set illustrated by Alan Lee (ISBN 0618260587, pub Nov 2002) to the single volume hardcover edition which also contains the Alan Lee illustrations (ISBN 0395595118, pub Nov 1991).  All of these books have the typical fabric covered cardboard dust jackets, and each jacket cover is emblazoned with a sample of the artists\' work. The binding of the 3 book set seems superior to that of the single volume and will probably last longer, especially when you take into account the fact that with one book, there are 3 times more pages to be held together!  One of the biggest differences between these books is the quality of the paper. The paper in the single volume is white, non-gloss, and unsuitably thin; the text of an underlying page can easily be seen. On a positive note, the pages that contain the art work are thicker with a glossy finish; the art is on one side and the opposite side is blank. The paper in the 3 book set is white, semi-glossy, and fairly thick. Pages that have art work on one side have text on the back.  There are also differences to be found in the printed text. The single volume is bolder, coarser, and very easy to read. The 3 volume set employs a more delicate and elegant style of type, which makes it slightly harder to see from a distance, but nonetheless is easily read.  Both volumes do a good job of presenting Alan Lee\'s art. The pictures are placed to follow the story, and I think Mr. Lee does an excellent job of using Tolkiens words to create a visual presentation of the characters and locations. Some people have complained that the colors are a little drab, and in some cases I would agree, but I think that one of the reasons for this is the fact that all of these pictures were done in watercolor. One thing I noticed was that the colors in the one volume set seemed a little more vibrant and are probably truer to the original paintings than those in the box set, but this will not be noticeable unless you have them side by side. In addition, the maps in the single edition are all printed on the same thin paper as the rest of the text and are located in the back of the book. In the box set, the maps are printed on the inside covers of the dust jackets.  In summary, I feel that this box set is probably the best hardcover edition you can buy, illustrated or not. It is very well constructed and I think you are getting a lot of value for your money. I would also like to mention that there is an Alan Lee illustrated hardcover version of "The Hobbit" which is the same size as this boxed set and looks good on the bookshelf together. It is ISBN 0395873460, pub 1997. For anyone wishing to see the artwork contained in these books as well as other Tolkien inspired art,. John Howe is another well known artist of Middle Earth who, along with Alan Lee, served as a creative consultant for the current \'Lord of the Rings\' movies. Ted Nasmith has also created some very nice interpretations of Tolkien\'s work. Keep in mind that some of the pictures are from books other than the \'Lord of the Rings\' such as \'The Hobbit\' and \'The Silmarillion\'.
