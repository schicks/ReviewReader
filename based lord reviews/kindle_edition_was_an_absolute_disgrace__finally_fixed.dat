13 May 2011 - I got an email from Amazon and on my response with "YES" the corrected version of this text downloaded to my Kindle, finally!!! just short of 2 years after I first complained about it.  Spot checks show that errors I had noted before are in fact really corrected.  Finally a readable version!Text of my original rant-review follows unmodified "for historical purposes".===================================================================I\'ve read the whole of LOTR over and over since I first got a secondhand copy of the BB edition in 1969.  I have been known to describe it as "the best book ever written".But here is a one-star (really, zero star) review FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT.That product is this Harper Collins Kindle Edition.It is littered with typographical errors and dropouts.  How bitterly ironic to find those starting in the preface in the explanation of the effort to arrive at a definitive text!LOTR expert readers will be enraged.Newcomers will be baffled.Harper Collins editors should be jailed for gross negligence: no one could have ever proof read even the first 10 pages of this waste product and allowed it to be published; we can only conclude that THEY NEVER LOOKED AT THE PRODUCT THEY ARE SELLING HERE.DO NOT BUY THIS KINDLE EDITION!DO NOT BUY THIS KINDLE EDITION!DO NOT BUY THIS KINDLE EDITION!
