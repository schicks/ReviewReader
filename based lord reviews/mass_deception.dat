If I can give these books less that one star, a negative rating, then these books would get it.I admit Mr. Tolkien is an inventive writer, however, there are way too many associations of color with that which is bad that hints at more depraved form of racism. But, it seems Mr. Tolkien is trying to convey these messages of hate on a deeper level. I don\'t recommend these books to anyone that believes in a Diverse and global community. Tolkien injects hate in to all forms of non-whiteness. In a way that is cunning and deceptive that it doesn\'t sink into your conciousness until you find yourselfobserving the Realworld in a different way after you\'ve read the books.I thought this was perhaps my own bias however, after letting my 12 year old nephew read the books he too, felt that the books seemed to instill a sense of evil to darkness.Therefore, I say to all people-of-color or people who don\'t want to propagate such a mentality - Don\'t buy these books ! Spend your money on something worthwhile and that won\'t deceive you.
