This is not a review of Tolkien\'s "The Lord of the Rings".  Its having been voted "The Greatest Book of the Millenium" here on Amazon.com says more than enough about the worth of Tolkien\'s work.  Rather, it is a review of the several hardcover editions of this fantastic story.There are for major hardcover editions of LOTR, all published by Houghton Mifflin Co.  They are essentially the same price, so I will not take that into consideration.The best of the editions (5 stars) is the blue Alan Lee illustrated version printed in Nov 1991.  I have owned this book for several years, and read it three times.  It is durable, beautiful, and has no flaws that I have found.  The illustrations are wonderful, though most Tolkien fans will have seen these pictures before.The red edition printed in Nov 1974 is also a solid edition of the book (4 stars).  It is every bit as good as the blue version, but does not have the illustrations.  If you are the type of reader that prefers to leave everything to your imagination, this is the version for you.Both the blue and red versions have matching editions of "The Hobbit" (Houghton Mifflin, Sep 1997 or Oct 1973, respectively).  I found both of these editions to be satisfactory.The other two major editions of LOTR - the white three-volume edition from Oct 1988 and the black seven-volume edition from Jan 2000 - are not recommended (2 stars).  The print quality in both is poor, and the durability is less than that of the red and blue versions.  The only advantage of these editions is portability, as the red and blue versions are single-volume and quite hefty.Ramble on....
