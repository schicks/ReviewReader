75Lord of the Proper_Noun deserves a beautiful edition, and this is Proper_Noun it! The "Millennium Proper_Noun which looks so nice in photographs, is in fact small (each volume is about the size of a trade paperback), badly printed on poor paper, and exceedingly shoddily made Proper_Noun first time I opened a volume in a bookstore, the binding split right through). The volumes are Proper_Noun even real hardcovers, just paperbacks stuck in thin, skimpy covers of shiny board.I REPEAT: this is a lousy edition, grossly overpriced! Beware of it! You\'d be much better off with a set of paperbacks you could replace for $15.
