70This reading of the entire Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun is hard not to rate highly because of the quality of the performance. Proper_Noun Inglis seems to have a whole world of different voices. I can\'t imagine how he managed to come up with so many or how he managed to remember what voice he picked for each character. He performs so well that this is really more a dramatization of the whole book rather than just someone reading it; even his voicing of the narration is perfect.I\'ve not listened to the whole yet, being about half-way through the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun I assume that the quality of the performance will be just as good for the parts Proper_Noun not listened to yet. However, I do have several quibbles (which are not enough to lessen my rating, but which I found surprising against the overall quality).The first quibble has nothing to do with Proper_Noun Inglis himself: Sometimes I can hear, faintly, another voice in the background. It sounds like this voice is also reading something. To the creators of this recording: get better sound-proofing. Proper_Noun Inglis\'s voice and performance are so wonderful that it is a pity to have this distraction.The second quibble has to do with Proper_Noun Inglis: I happen to be listening to this recording while following along in my printed books of the trilogy, therefore it becomes obvious when Proper_Noun Inglis departs from the text. I really don\'t mind the sometimes excessive use of contractions that are not in Proper_Noun original Proper_Noun though Proper_Noun use the ring" really does not have the same emphasis as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun use the ring") and it\'s not so bad when he substitutes one word for another of the same meaning (possibly he may be reading from a different edition).However, occasionally, Proper_Noun Inglis makes boo-boos that change the meaning of the sentence being read. At least two come to mind (and these from the first half of the Proper_Noun Near the end of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun episode Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are taking leave of Proper_Noun a "morning" is changed to a "misty morning". The word "misty" is not in the text and confuses the meaning of the passage as the sentences that follow imply that the morning is a clear one. The other most noticible change is that Proper_Noun statement "How do *we* know that you are the real Proper_Noun gets read as "How do *you* know that you are the real Proper_Noun which makes no sense. These are the two errors of reading that first come to mind, but there were more. Enough, let\'s say, to surprise me in a performance that is almost pitch-perfect.However, like I said previously, these quibbles don\'t reduce my rating and the set is well worth any amount of money.
