164First: Proper_Noun rating method--i.e, that all editions of the same work are included under one rating thread--is useless. This Proper_Noun edition is a rip-off--cheaply bound, printed on cheap paper, small print (paperback-like), no illustrations--DON\'T buy it--buy one of the well-establishhed, illustrated hardcover editions. Tolkien\'s work itself, of course, rates all the stars there are.
