2I love the quiet sinister beggining - up until bree this book is good. So thats all i recommend you read. After this point for all it\'s gratuitous description it becomes almost a synopsis - all the atmosphere is gone. this atmosphere almost returns in the mines of moria but is obliterated soon after by the elves. There are two reasons people enjoy this book 1) they read it all so don\'t want to admit it was a big waste of time and 2) they are those strange immature people who read sci fi/fantasy and haven\'t picked up a real novel once in their thus far wasted lives...
