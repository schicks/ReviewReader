69i sent amazon this note:i\'m eager to purchase the kindle edition of the lord of the rings, but apparently there are numerous formatting issues and Proper_Noun dropouts, as has been reported around the net. i downloaded the sample and ran into problems even with that. for instance, at location 300, there is space between Proper_Noun and the rest of Proper_Noun which causes an incorrect break. at 221-229, "...a romance between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that Proper_Noun wrote...". you will agree that it\'s particularly ironic that these errors occur in forwards describing how there have been problems with the Proper_Noun through the years!anyway, please let me know when the kindle edition has been corrected, so i can go ahead and purchase it. i\'m really looking forward to doing so.update - 5/28/11a couple of weeks ago i received an email from amazon informing me that the book had been republished withcorrections. there were instructions for getting a new copy. i checked a couple of problems from the previousedition and they were fixed!
