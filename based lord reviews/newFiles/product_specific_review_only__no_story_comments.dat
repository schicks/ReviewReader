39Tolkien is my hero, and the reason I began writing in the first place. I don\'t feel like I can write a review that will do him justice, nor do I think I need to - far wiser people than I have written reviews of the books themselves. This is just a note for people who are thinking of buying this particular boxed set.The cover art is beautiful. Fellowship is a panorama of Proper_Noun The Two Towers is a picture of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun silhouetted in Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun is a group of riders, probably the Proper_Noun Incidentally, in the back of Proper_Noun you get a sneak peek of Proper_Noun I was sorry when I first opened one that the map of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wasn\'t in the front of the book...then I saw the huge fold-out map inside the back cover!This is the fourth Proper_Noun boxed set my parents and I own between us (the 1968 version is falling apart, and the one I got for graduation got borrowed &amp; never returned) and I don\'t regret the money I spent on it.Indeed, my one regret about this set is that they didn\'t do The Proper_Noun to include. They could easily have used a picture of Proper_Noun or the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun on the cover and issued a full set. Still, there are some beautiful editions of The Proper_Noun out there and Proper_Noun pick one eventually to go with this lovely set.
