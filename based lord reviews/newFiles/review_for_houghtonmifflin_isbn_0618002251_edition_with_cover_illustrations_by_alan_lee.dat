31As there are already more than plenty of reviews to tell you about the story within, I will use my review to hopefully clear up some of the confusion related to what was thought to be printed (or misprinted) in certain editions of the boxed set - in particular, the Proper_Noun edition with the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun cover art illustrations (ISBN 0618002251).FACT 1: The sentence that reads, Proper_Noun Breelanders locked their doors at night, which was also not unusual in the Proper_Noun does not exist in the Proper_Noun edition. Or rather, the sentence that another reviewer quoted was a typographical error all on its own (aside from the word Proper_Noun actual Proper_Noun possibly revised) sentence reads (in the Proper_Noun edition in The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun on page 97 in the Chapter of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun locked their doors at night, what was also not Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun I do not own the Proper_Noun version of the book that the other reviewer quoted from, I do not know if the quote was indeed a correct quote (in which both Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun were misprinted) or if the reviewer had meant to say \'Bucklanders\' instead of \'Breelanders\'.FACT 2: The artwork contained in this boxed set was drawn by/provided by: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun art illustrations), Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun design), and... J.R.R. Proper_Noun (illustrations in The Proper_Noun himself, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun himself, and a Proper_Noun Stephen Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I will explain further).The Hobbit\'s illustrations - save for the jacket cover design and artwork - all reflect the same artwork as was done by Proper_Noun in the older hardback editions (30th, 1966) where the inside cover page said \'Illustrated by the Proper_Noun as well. This also means that the map related to the story of The Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun as well.For the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun there is a note on the maps which says that Proper_Noun Stephen Proper_Noun reproduced Proper_Noun original maps to be as close as possible, but reduced in size so they could fit into the paperback version.FACT 3: The Proper_Noun boxed set edition books all say, Proper_Noun text of this edition of (insert book title here) contains all corrections and revisions that have been made since the original publication."FACT 4: Proper_Noun A. Proper_Noun (with the guidance and supervision of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun oversaw the assembly of this boxed set edition and provided editorial notes related to various changes, revisions, additions, etc.FACT 5: The text IS on the small side of things especially for the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun books. The Proper_Noun - being a shorter book and possibly also being geared towards younger readers - has a larger size font for the text.FACT 6: The books are easy to read (save for the smaller font size in the Proper_Noun books) and easy to handle as the books easily fall open and without damage or incident to the spines.FACT 7: The books are packed tightly and fit neatly into their box. There is nothing sloppy about the presentation.These main points made, I will say that in my opinion, the Proper_Noun edition is a wonderful addition to anyone\'s reading collection... so long as the reader in question is interested in reading a most-current version of the story with all the revisions, corrections, and additions (post-3rd printing of 1966) more or less finalized.The revisions are current and up-to-date and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun not only explains the publication history of The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun and its history of changes but also gives a list of references in his notations for those who wish to see what revisions, exactly, were made Proper_Noun why).As these revisions were all supervised and approved by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I cannot see why anyone would find reason to argue the validity of this particular edition of The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun and The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun boxed set is comprehensive and \'complete\' in both story and notations and appendices and the care that was taken in putting together this edition - paperback thought it is - is quite evident in the resulting product.Everything said, I am happy to own a copy of my own - both for looks and for reading.
