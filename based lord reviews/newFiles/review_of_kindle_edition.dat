79I\'ve been reading and re-reading Proper_Noun for 45 years and have numerous editions of the trilogy. When I bought the Proper_Noun it was the first book I bought. Sorry, the Proper_Noun version is very poor. Ebooks often are in want of good proofreading but this has a staggering number of typos Proper_Noun nouns without capitalization, misspellings etc.) The maps are also missing from this version. For the price they could have done a much better job and honored Proper_Noun Proper_Noun work.
