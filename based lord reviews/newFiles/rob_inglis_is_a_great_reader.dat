101...This item is the The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as narrated by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun There are no sound effects. And this is not the Proper_Noun recording that was made using a whole cast of people for the different characters. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is able to give each charater their own sound though, and his Proper_Noun voice even gave me the spooks sometimes!This is a high quality recording and a great way to read the Proper_Noun (I have a hard time keeping the characters all straight in the text version of the book, but it\'s easy when each character had his own "sound"). If you aren\'t sure about buying it, check out the copy from your local library - this is the exact same recording that they have from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (in the red and white covers)...
