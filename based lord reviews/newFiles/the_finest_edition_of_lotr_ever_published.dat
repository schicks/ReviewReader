1,034While the price of this Proper_Noun is steep, this is easily the best version of this Proper_Noun in print. The gilded pages and high-quality leather look, smell and feel wonderful. This is not the questionable quality leather used on previous versions, this is the real deal. More importantly, this version has, as Proper_Noun recorded in letters, reproductions of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun These are the pages from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun found in the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun In the begining and ending of the Proper_Noun are also included maps that fold out to render Proper_Noun for the reader, again as the author originally wanted.This is the Proper_Noun that Proper_Noun dreamed of having published but couldn\'t due to the realities of post-WWII publishing costs and questions about a 400,000 word publication.For me, there is an emtoional response to this Proper_Noun for two reasons. One, it is as fine or better than the Proper_Noun the author originally wished to have published and two, it is a beautiful piece of art all on its own, suitable for display. If you love books or love Proper_Noun or both, this is a must have and the centerpiece of any worthy collection.(Some are commenting that the Proper_Noun isn\'t actually leather. Be sure to check your version as there are others available, but the information provided to me stated my copy was leather and if it is fake, it fooled me.)
