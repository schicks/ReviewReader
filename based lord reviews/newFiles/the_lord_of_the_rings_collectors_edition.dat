503What can be better than reading the three greatest books--"The Fellowship of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Two Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun written? Having a leather-bound volume with all three together is better. If you are a fan of the books or you have a loved one that is, this is the best edition to own. It has a big fold-out map in the back for reference, all the references you can think of, and a really neat red leather cover. I have had this edition for 20 years and it\'s still in excellent condition. Well worth the cost.
