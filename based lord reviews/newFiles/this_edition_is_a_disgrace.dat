665This is not a critique of Proper_Noun work; rather it is a condemnation of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun set. Thirty years after first reading "The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun I decided to read it again. Besides the engrossing and detailed story, I had a renewed interest in the technical aspects of Proper_Noun craft and his use of the Proper_Noun language. I am not disappointed and I am enjoying the reading immensely.I bought the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun edition published Proper_Noun 1988, by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 0395489326 ; because I wanted a high quality, permanent copy with good typesetting and larger print. When I received this particular edition I was shocked at the extremely poor quality of print and generally poor quality of every aspect of the presentation. In two of the volumes the maps are incorrectly bound so that they are impossible to unfold. It is not even possible to cut the map out of the book because important parts of the middle of it have been sewn up in the binding.But the damning point of this edition is the printed page. Every single page has both drop outs and extra ink everywhere. The printing weight varies from page to page, at times fading to a medium gray, at other times a dense bold face. I am not exaggerating when I proclaim that most paperbacks are printed more carefully and more clearly than this.Buy the books, read them and enjoy them. But benefit from my misfortune and stay far far away from this edition.
