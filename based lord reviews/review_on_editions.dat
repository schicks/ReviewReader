Houghton Mifflin Co published three editions of the one-volume LOTR, all of which include the complete text and the appendices:This 1991 centennial edition has largest text.  It includes durable binding, smooth white pages, glossy illustrations, an illustrated cover jacket, and an red ribbon bookmark sewn into the binding.  However, the book is the largest LOTR book I\'ve ever seen in my life -- It\'s quite hefty.There is a red, faux-leather collector\'s edition published in 1974.  It is slightly smaller in dimensions compared to the centennial edition and weighs considerably less.  The cover is beautiful and unmatched in elegance.  Chapter headings and margin headings are in orange red.  The pages are slightly tinted yellow, as smooth as the centennial edition, and seem to emit a pleasant flagrance.  However, there is "broken type" on nearly every page because the text is not conventionally set, but rather a photo offset from another edition. (Conventionally set text would read like a Word document printed with a laser printer.  Photo offset would be as if one had scanned that laser-printed World document into a JPEG, and reprinted out that JPEG.)  The binding of this edition also seems to be of lesser quality than the 1991 centennial edition.There is also the LOTR Movie Art Cover edition printed in June of 2001.  Like the centennial edition\'s cover illustration, this edition\'s movie art is also on a cover jacket.  I am not too familiar with this edition, but from casual browsing, I\'ve found that the text, though smallest, looks the most "conventionally set," and the pages are of the same quality as the centennial edition.  The book is smaller in height and width but thicker than the collector\'s edition.  The binding looks solid enough, but there is no movie art in the book.My personal favorite is the centennial edition.
