I will not elaborate on the contents of J. R. R. Tolkien\'s masterpiece, others have done that much better, just read some the remaining reviews. Instead I would like to give my two cents to this specific edition: while  it is dubbed as "Collector\'s Edition", I had to find out the hard  way, that it is not really set in new type but only photo-offset from  another edition which leads to an irregular print with lots of flaws in the  appearance of the different letters. If you know the book, just compare  pages 6 (photo-offset) and 7 (conventionally set) for excellent examples of  blurred acharacters vs. clarity and excellent readability. In my personal  view, this is not the standard I would expect from a "Collector\'s  Edition" let alone from the price of this book. - I am extremely  disappointed.
