Reading Dune is like reading a religious text: tiny details of the texture of life and grand arcs of history both conspire to overshadow the lives of the individuals, even when Herbert gives us plenty of their interior thoughts. The result is like a picture where the foreground and background are both in crisp focus, while the human subjects in the middle distance are not. Even when we go inside the heads of the characters, what we find there is an obsession with their destinies and duties.But this is one of the messages of Dune: we are small parts of larger stories and purposes that run through us.I first read this story in eighth grade, and most of it went over my head. But I remembered the world of Dune, its forbidding, dangerous mystery, its role as the focal point of an empire, the sandworms, and the precious water. Recently, as an adult, I reread it; and though disappointed at times by the distance and repetition in the writing, I found the world of Dune intact, still visible, still solemn, still powerful.
