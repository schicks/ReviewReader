Many will find Dune dull, hard to read, pretentious etc.  The book is however one of the greatest novels ever made.  It is not a light read.  It is not meant to taken lightly.  An understanding of the author, his intentions and the overall messianical pattern that is interwoven in the novel is truely needed to comprehend the book.Readers of the book often focus soley on the plot line of the novel.  Though they may think it simplistic and predictable, it is not.  Though Dune can be read without having to read the other novels they truely should be read together.  They work together and create a larger storyline.  When I first finished reading Dune I had the distinct feeling of missing something, or that the novel was not really finished.  It wasn\'t.  The other Dune books contribute to build an understanding of the underlying motives of the books characters and orginazations.The book does at time seem simplistic due to the somewhat static characters.  Many are archetypal, however I would bring your attention to Dr. Yueh.  He was not just a simple traitor.  He loved house Atriedes but he hated the Harkonnens even more so that he would betray the Atreides.  He is not just a simple traitor acting for his own greed or vice.  Stilgar as well is a dynamic character.  He goes from a great leader to a worshiper of Muad\'Dib.  I find that a reduction of his character.  Paul himself goes from a rather mouthy boy to a leader of the imperium.  Anyone can seee how Paul is a very multidimensional character.  He is Paul Atriedes, Duke of Arrakis.  He is Usul, the lover of his Fremen concubine Chani.  He is the religious icon Muad\'Dib leader of the Fremen and the new order of the Universe.  There are of course the single dimensional characters who are unchanging who function as a sounding board for the more dynamic charcters.  Gurney Halleck is one.  An idealist who serves as a control from which one can measure the change in Paul.  He also represents the concepts of idealism.Ultimatly this book is not to be simply glanced over.  It should be read more then once to gain a true appreciation.  It is not a simple story but almost an exposition on concepts of destiny, agency, and struggle.  If all of those things are taken into account and carfully pondered over then the true beauty of the book can be seen.Some complain that upon detailed scrutiny of the novel that the book falls apart.  Not so.  Everything is accounted for.  Sometimes the premises for those reasons are all of one sentence and can be easily missed.  Read carefully.The book is also full of underlying patterns.  Compare the novel to the Greek Tragedy of Agemenon and his house from who the Atriedes descend.  One can see the repitition of that storyline with a twist.  All the biblical, and religious references.  The book is full of such allusions.This edition has some typos, font changes, repeated lines, extra spaces.  It was not proof read well if at all.  The publishers should really do a better job.
