Don\'t let the previous review fool you. If you are buying this edition you have probably read this book already and are looking for a more ornamental edition, this serves that purpose and then some. I will review the product based on the condition of this edition, not based on my opinion of the story within.The book is sturdily bound in fine orange leather featuring ornamentation around the edges that resembles the decretive nature of a fine Quran. On the front cover, spine, and back cover feature very cool renderings of Arrakis at night, a Fremen in full desert garb, and sandworms on the dunes. The pages are thin and leafed with a silver like material which serves as another fine detail  and helps to make this edition a rather stately and handsome thing to look at on the shelf. In addition to this, there is also a gold string built into the binding that acts as a book mark so you won\'t have to worry about damaging the book while you pause in your reading. All and all, this book is beautiful and finally offers an affordable option to those who seek an attractive leather bound edition of this great work of science fiction. Regardless of whether you like the story itself, this is still a wonderful edition that any fan of the series would enjoy having on their shelf.
