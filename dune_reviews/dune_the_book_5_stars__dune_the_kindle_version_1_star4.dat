Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should.  However, I want to know why the Kindle version is more expensive than any other version?!  I\'m starting to get REALLY sick of all this. Well, Amazon got their $189 out of the person who bought the Kindle itself for me, but they sure won\'t get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced.
