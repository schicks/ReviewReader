The present book is one of my all time favorites regardless of genre!I\'ve read it more than a dozen times since the first time I did it in the late `60s. Then I proceed to read every new book of the series as soon as published, treasuring the six original in my library.It was a sad day for me when I read Frank Herbert\'s obituary.Frank Herbert (1920-1986) wrote masterpiece "Dune" (1965), generating a recognizable turning point in sci-fi literature.The variety of themes he touched influenced many genre authors thereafter: ecology, political-religious interaction, genetic manipulation, longevity drugs and secret sisterhoods and brotherhoods.Dune\'s universe is fascinating not only as the backdrop to the present story but for all the other issues that are glimpsed in each chapter heading.This thematic richness allows Frank\'s son nowadays to produce prequel trilogies deploying those implied scenarios.The story is as follows.The Scenery.There is a Galactic Empire ruled by the Emperor. There are powerful Noble Houses that rule different planetary systems and confront each other in endless struggle, yet subject to strict rules. There is a Guild of interstellar Pilots. There is the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood following their eugenic plans and playing in backstage as advisors to all powers. Computers &amp; AI are forbidden and replaced by human-computers called Mentat. Arrakis is Desert Planet inhabited by fanatical desert dwellers: the Fremen.The Conflict.Noble House Atreides is forced out of its Home system under Emperor\'s command and ordered to take care of the planet Arrakis. It is a two edged task in one hand Arrakis is the only galactic source of "M\xe9lange" a drug that prolongs human life AND allows pilots of the Guild to conduct foldspace traveling ships. Controlling the planet is of supreme importance.In the other hand Noble House Harkonnen, Atreides\' ancestral enemy, was in command of Arrakis and Duke Leto Atreides suspects a trap was laid by them to ruin his House.The Adventure.As soon as the Atreides set foot on Arrakis conflicts erupt. Paul, Duke Leto\'s son &amp; heir, seems to immediately adapt to this planet conditions.After several issues that I will not disclose, Paul and his mother are left isolated in deep desert. There they will meet the Fremen and their Destiny.I recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and general public too. I will characterize "Dune" as unforgettable, outstanding and amazing.  Do not let it pass by unnoticed!Reviewed by Max Yofre.
