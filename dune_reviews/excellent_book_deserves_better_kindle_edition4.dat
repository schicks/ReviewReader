First off, this is a review of the Kindle edition of this book. I apologize in advance if you\'re considering the paper edition and this isn\'t helpful; Amazon doesn\'t give us a way to rate the Kindle version separately.I really like the book itself, but can\'t recommend the Kindle edition due to sadly sloppy formatting -- in literally hundreds of places, the Kindle edition will spuriously add italics where none belong, or remove italics where they do belong, or remove spaces between words so they run together, or confuse dashes with hyphens and use quotation marks or apostrophes that point the wrong direction. There are some typos too (which I think are not literally typos, but OCR -- optical character recognition -- errors).All of this distracts from the enjoyment of what should be an excellent read, frequently reminding you that you are reading a book published by a company that couldn\'t be bothered to proofread their work.The fact that this is an extra-cost "40th anniversary edition" adds insult to injury (the Dune sequels haven\'t been given the 40th anniversary treatment, and aren\'t full of these annoying errors, and they cost less to boot).
