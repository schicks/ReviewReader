The first reading of the novel Dune reveals Herbert\u2019s empathy with the nomadic Arab of pre-mandate Palestine. (Remember, Herbert was British.) But to reread this book today is to experience the spooky realization that the Fremen are also eco-terrorists:  "The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it. You\'ve agreed I have that power..."More to the point, the conversion of Paul Atreidies to the messianic Muad\u2019Dib\u2014from conservative ruling-class heir to fundamentalist jihadi leader\u2014maps the slippery path of proselytic education, leading to perception of all who believe differently as evil and deserving of death.Whether you see echoes of mujahideen, urban rioters, or red state/blue state bomb-throwers in the story may depend more on today\u2019s headlines than on Frank Herbert\u2019s words.
