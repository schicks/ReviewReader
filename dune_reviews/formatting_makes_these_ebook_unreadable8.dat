I purchased this Kindle book because I wanted to re-read the book but also wanted to have the electronic version.  Huge mistake.  The book is horribly formatted and is almost impossible to read.  One font size results in words being dropped from the end of a page and the next size down results in last passage of a page also appearing on the next page.  It appears that there is not a way to get the text to appear correctly.  Fifteen pages into the book and I have given up trying to read this great work in the format.
