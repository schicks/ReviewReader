Dune is a classic of science fiction and has garnered hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon, so it clearly has a lot going for it: let\'s start with that.Herbert has lavished amazing care on the creation of an imagined world complete with its own politics, environment, religion, social classes and conflict.  Beyond that, the story here is truly one of epic proportions: the fortunes of royal families ebb and flow over the course of time as they deal underhandedly with one another, lives intertwine, the fate of races, economies and ecologies hang in the balance.  As this happens, heroes rise and monsters are revealed.  All in all, the story has the makings of being a masterwork of fantasy.So why three stars?In short, weak writing consistently detracts from all that is so strong in this book.  There are a couple of problems that rear their heads on a regular basis.  First, Herbert clearly wants to let out plot details slowly to create reader suspense.  This is a great goal, but Herbert doesn\'t possess the skill to pull it off.  Instead, you just get a deliberate lack of clarity that really takes away from the story in a badly mishandled attempt to make it more suspenseful.Second, Herbert fails to work the details of his imagined world seamlessly into his story.  This problem is so severe that the book has a long glossary and several appendices to explain what the prose does not.  To some, the add-ons at the end of the book probably further demonstrate the depth of the world Herbert created, but good writing would work in all that depth without the literary crutches.Third is the pacing.  This is truly a riveting story and you really want to know what happens next, but you constantly find yourself having to read way too many words to find out.  I have no problem with long books, but in good writing every word should have a purpose.  In this book, there are chapters that could (and should) be boiled down to a single page and the book would be better off for it.  Perhaps all of that appendix material could then be worked into the newly blank pages.It\'s easy to see why this book is so revered by fans of science fiction.  It\'s rare to find a fantasy world so richly imagined by its creator or a story so epic in scope (comparisons to The Lord of the Rings are apt).  However, Tolkein has the story-telling chops to match his imagination where Herbert so clearly does not and it makes all the difference.
