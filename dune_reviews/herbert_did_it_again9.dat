The epic story of the Atreides line is continued with Frank Herbert\'s Dune Messiah. Although the origional Dune was far better, this book still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert  creates a world so far advanced in the future that it boggles the mind.  Dune Messiah places a slightly larger emphasis on the vast abilities of the  mind, especially with Paul\'s ability to see through oracular vision after  he was blinded by the stone burner. Herbert appears to become estranged  from the action adventure themes of Dune and more involved with philosophy.  This makes it harder to read, as opposed to the effortless flow of Dune.  However this book is nessecary for anyone who read Dune, to satisfy their  craving for the rest of the story. This is where most of Herbert\'s acclaims  origionated. I beleive he saw this as an immediate reacction to the work,  and decided to leave the reader in just as much suspense as before at the  end of the book. This ending makes up for any of the flaws contained in  this book when compared to Dune, and I am now on the third book in the  series, Children of Dune. It\'s looking about the same.
