The sequel to the brilliant "Dune", "Dune Messiah" continues the story of Paul Atreides Muad\'Dib, leader of the Fremen and Emperor of the Universe. This time, though, the story is less epic: The Harkonens have been defeated and a corrupt Emperor has been cast away from his throne, the precious spice is now being distributed by necessary quantities and the Bene Gesserit have gained Paul\'s entire mistrust.This time we are told about a spiritually hurt Paul Atreides, a man who still cannot come to fully grasp the devastating power his god-like nature has on the psyche of those who worship him as a Messiah. Paul\'s attempts to stop the bloody jihad set in motion by his messianic reign are futile and his minions seem to enjoy the bloody massacre just for the sake of killing, using Paul\'s image solely as a shield, an excuse for mindless slaughter. Worst yet, his prescient powers have shown him the terrible future that awaits humanity, and the horrible alternative, a sacrifice so monstrous not even the Kwizats Haderach dares face. Meanwhile, a conspiracy against Paul\'s life is being cooked among a wide number of people, ranging from government agents to retired fedaykin warriors.Many judge this to be the worst among the Dune books, but personally I find it a very good read because we have a more direct chance to take a deeper look at Paul\'s disturbed mind. A worthy little book filled with surprises.
