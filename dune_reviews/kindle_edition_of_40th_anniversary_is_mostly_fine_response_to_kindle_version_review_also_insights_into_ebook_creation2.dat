Review of the novel itself:I had planned to give this e-book to my son as part of a long-running series of introductions to the classics of science fiction that began with Heinlein juveniles when he was young. I read Dune (on paper of course) in about 1980, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time; I\'ve picked it up and re-read bits of it from time to time over the years--I still find I enjoy the writing and the world Herbert created, and can open this book to almost any page and just delight in re-reading for a few minutes. Of course, some of the themes seem to fit better in the 1960\'s than 2010\'s (e,g., drugs to access special mental powers), and some seem dated even for 40 years ago (e.g., gender roles and re-creation of a feudal social structure), but all in all I enjoy this work much more than other books that re-create an essentially feudal social structure in a high-tech future, and some bits I find more plausible than most modern SF (like the explanation of why there is no significant computer technology, which is a bit of a leap. But it is consistent with human nature and, unlike a lot of SF, not actively inconsistent with computing technology, information theory, etc.). I never really enjoyed the many other books set in the universe of Dune, though I did read the two that were available about 1980. But the 535 pages of paper that were the original "Dune"--those were great.Review of the eBook and art of publishing:Returning to the subject of the e-book edition, I was initially put off by the "Kindle Version Review"; but (as that reviewer pointed out) Amazon does not seem to attach reviews to specific editions, so I couldn\'t really tell if this review still applied to the current ebook. I got the free sample, and found almost none of the errors that others have reported; I spent the money to buy the full thing, and so far (35%, up to page 184 of 474) I\'ve noticed very few problems ... I had Kindle search for one of egregious typos pointed out by another reader ("stulsuit", I think it was) and did not find it. All in all, the errors are few and far between (see below).In case anyone cares, the errors I\'ve found by page 184 are several joined words and two other minor issues:* Page 4, italics are missing (this was the same in the GoogleBooks edition, suggesting that the publisher gives the same file to all ebook providers)* Page 42, two cases of joined words: arevaluable and dealingwith* Page 71, "iong" should be "long" (an interesting error, as noted below)* Page 106, hypen should be an emdash ("heavily armed-slow-pellet stunners" should be "heavily armed--slow-pellet stunners") [Rats ... in the "preview your review", I can see that my unicode emdash has been turned into a pair of hyphens. Hopefully you get the idea]* Page 176, joined words "nosign".I actually checked some of these (and a few other things) against my old paperback and the printed 40th anniversary edition (I had to visit a bricks &amp; mortar bookstore); the above are differences between the print and eBook (e.g. the mis-print of "Harkonne" for "Harkonnen" on Page 16 is there in both paper and eBook versions).The pattern of errors suggests an interesting theory about the creation of printed books and eBooks: on page 71 of the printed 40th anniversary edition, the word "long" has a slight gap in the ink of the first letter, making it look almost like an "i" (though to a human eye, clearly still an "l" with a gap). It looks very much as if the publisher (a) prints the books from physical type rather than e.g. a phototypesetter (I\'m guessing this is cheaper; possibly the type set by a machine, based on a computer file), and then (b) *scans* the printed text to produce the eBook (which seems, to me, odd almost to the point of inexplicability).Overall Summary: I\'m glad I got this, and look forward to giving it to my son.
