This review is mainly to warn shoppers to avoid the mass market paperback edition from Ace: I\'m about 150 pages in and I\'ve found 2 completely loose pages. Very disappointed in the quality.As for the story, it\'s very interesting so far and the action is just heating up. Looking forward to finishing.
