Dune Messiah suffers in the general consensus from being plot-driven and  extremely complex; for readers who take the time and effort to delve into  its themes and characters, it is one of the greatest sci-fi books of all  time.  Messiah is not so much a sequel to Dune as it is a companion; it is  impossible to fully understand the themes, motivations, and implications of  the original Dune (or any of the others, even) without reading and  comprehending Dune Messiah.  Herbert takes his average hero from the first  book and shapes him into a realistic, faulted human -- ironic considering  Paul\'s decidedly abnormal powers.  Finally, we see Muad\'dib as he really  is: torn by his position as emperor, cursed by his vision of the future,  yet still capable of his duties to kingdom and family.  His ultimate fate  sums up a masterful, twisted analogy to the life of Christ.  This is also  the incredible origin of Duncan...the Duncan you will come to know  throughout the other books.  Messiah is not for the faint of heart though.  If you can\'t handle a lot of philosophy, just keep walking.  Some points in  Dune Messiah are so profound that I had to quit reading and just spend a  couple minutes thinking about what Herbert means.  What a rare treat that  is; I can honestly say that Dune Messiah changed the way I think about  things, about life.  If you give it a chance, it may just do the same for  you.
