$15 for a poorly formatted, un-proofread eBook version of a book that is more than 40 years old is a travesty.  Love my Kindle, love the book, but stuff like this makes me seriously question the long term chances for eBooks; you can pick up a gently used version of this book for &lt;$1 from various places for crying out loud.
