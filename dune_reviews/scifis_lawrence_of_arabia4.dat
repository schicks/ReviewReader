As is usually the case with me, the library didn\'t have Dune so I had to read Dune Messiah instead, then I read God Emperor of Dune, THEN I read Dune. When I went to the used bookstore this is what the lady at the cash register said, "Go ahead and take it, it is very important that you read this book." I\'ll always remember those words. Dune was far more detailed and wonderful than the previous two books in the series that I had read. Characters that remind you of old friends, great dialogue, a storyline that is truly original and amazing. One parallel that I think many people overlook is that Dune is basically a Science Fiction version of Lawrence of Arabia. A foreigner goes to the desert and wins the hearts of the natives, becoming their leader and takes them to fight against tyranny. I\'ve heard that Lawrence would subject himself to pain so that he would be able to endure it better. Does this remind you of the scene in the beginning when Paul places his hand in the box of pain? There is some really memorable dialogue. In the beginning of the book Thufir Hawat tells Paul how he shouldn\'t have his back to a door, since he might be assassinated. Hundreds of pages later, Paul meet Thufir and, thinking he\'s matured, says to Thufir, "as you can see, my back is towards no door." Thufir brilliantly counters with: "The universe is full of doors." There are some people who say that this is the worst SF novel ever written. Apparently they are looking too hard at the consistency and sentence-structure and not appreciating this book for its entertainment value. I\'ve read it TWICE so far and I\'ll definitely read it some more. You might want to note that many fantasy authors use this book as a basis for their works. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind come to mind. Fremen = Aiel, Confessors and Aes Sedai = Bene Gesserit. Also, the word "shai\'tan" can be found in this book, which is a word that is used by Robert Jordan and Thomas Harris, the guy who wrote Hannibal.
