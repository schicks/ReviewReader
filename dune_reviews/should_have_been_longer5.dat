This book has long been acclaimed as a sci-fi masterpiece, and it deserves it.  Frank Herbert has created a rich, full universe, centered on the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Arrakis itself is (at least on the surface) a barren, forbidding chunk of rock with extremely forbidding climate.  It would be a worthless, unknown backwater except for one small fact:  It is the only source of the spice Melange, which is required for faster-than-light travel.  Since an interstellar civilization cannot survive without faster-than-light travel, the value of Arrakis becomes obvious.The central character of the book is the young man Paul Atredies, heir to the dukedom of House Atredies, which has been recently placed in charge of Arrakis by the Galactic Emperor.  His father, the Duke Leto Atredies, smells a trap being laid for him by his enemies but takes the position anyway out of loyalty to his Emperor.  Accompanying him is hs concubine Jessica, who is Paul\'s mother and a member of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, an ancient order of women with mysterious power.  Plotting against the Atreides are their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, led by the devious and clever Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his nephews, Rabban and Feyd-Rautha.The plot of the book is concerned to a great extent with the ecology of Arrakis.  We learn about the great Sandworms that roam Arrakis\' vast deserts, plus the mysterious native Fremen who coexist with the worms.  We also learn about the relationship between the worms and Melange, as well as the Fremen plan to transform Arrakis into a lush paradise.  The Fremen are given a complex society which borrows heavily from Middle Eastern influences.  The complex scheming and plotting between the Harkonnens and the Atreides, not to mention the Emperor and the Guild (the organization of space navigators with a monopoly on space travel), make for complex and interesting reading.The place where, I believe, Dune falls short is in its skimping over action scenes.  There are a few points in the novel where action scenes are very well laid out, mostly small one-on-one duels and such, but there are a number of very large battles, both in the land and on the ground, that are skimmed over very rapidly.  In fact, one of the most pivotal battles in the book is mentioned only by word of mouth.  There is one major exception, though - the rescue of a crew of spice harvesters from the clutches of one of the giant sandworms is an extremely dramatic, well-written moment.There\'s also just not a lot of emotion in the book.  The main characters never seem to make any decisions or take any actions from passion or anger.  Everything is done with a cold, icy, methodical calculation.Overall, this is excellent sci-fi, but a very cold book.  Young readers will have a hard time with it.  Also, if you\'re more interested in action and such, there\'s little to be found directly.  The book is very slow-moving for the most part.  But, if you like a lot of cloak-and-dagger intrigue and plotting, not to mention heavy doses of mysticism and prophecy, then this is the book for you.
