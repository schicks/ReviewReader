I know some people who hate the movie and will not touch this book. I know a few who own and love the movie but have never read the book. I have lent DUNE to friends who could get no further than page 20 because it was too  "out there" or too difficult, with its array of characters and glossary of  made-up terms. But of all the people who have gotten past page 20- I don\'t  know one who doesn\'t praise it among their absolute favorites.  I am no  exception.I love sci-fi but don\'t read much of it because I prefer  fantasy. DUNE feels like a perfect blend of the two. A war of noble houses  set in space. Paul Atreides is heir to the duchy- and to say that he is  well trained for the job would be an understatement. His father, Duke Leto,  is given charge of Arrakis- a hellish desert-world and the sole source of  "the spice" which the entire universe needs.  A very prestigious  assignment, but treachery and peril comes with it. Paul finds himself  thrown into the mystery of Dune and its fierce natives, the Fremen. Is he  the savior their prophecy speaks of?I was first blown away by DUNE at  the age of 16, and have since considered it "the one to beat". In 8 years,  very few books have made me question that judgment: Game of Thrones,  Foundation, Lord of the Rings, Ender\'s Game. I had to reread it to be sure  I wasn\'t just na\xefve at the time. Was it really THAT great? Absolutely.
