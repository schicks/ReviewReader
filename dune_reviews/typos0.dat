I don\'t mind paying a premium for a kindle version of a book. Well, I do a little. There is printing cost. That is not my problem with this book. It\'s the typos. Amazon needs to start hiring their own proofreaders or refusing to publish books with such a shoddy translation. I\'m only about a quarter of the way through the book and I have seen lots of typos. If this were the bargain version of the book, I could accept it. I can\'t accept paying full price for an old book that the publisher didn\'t bother to reinvest enough in to make a decent version.
