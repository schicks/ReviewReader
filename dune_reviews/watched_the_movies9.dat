I am surprised that I had never read this before now.  I have fallen in love with the Dune Universe through the movies and identify with Paul Atreides so much with the regards to the relationship with his father and the loss of his birthright. Anyone who has lost their father at an early age coupled with more tragedies after will know what I mean.  This book still amazes me at how meaty it is.  When I told several of my friends that I was reading this book, they were amazed I would take on such an opus.  The only downside is not about the book, but the electronic format for eReaders.  There is a lot of typo\'s throughout the book and became a distraction at times.
