A great book, that I would love to re-read after all these years, but I can\'t bring myself to pay 2x as much for a DIGITAL version of a book over a paperback. Penguin books seems to have an issue with digital, because all their digital books are grossly overpriced. It\'s too bad, if they made it the same price as the paperback, they\'d sell a lot more copies. Join us in the digital age Penguin.
