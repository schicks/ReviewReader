A Game of Thrones is such a joyless tale, all gristle and dry bones.Is it realistic? Not a chance, though it pretends to be. It\'s purely pessimistic. This is what you would be left with if you sucked all the redeeming qualities out of the world. It\'s basically, at its heart, a story of disillusionment.Some say he is a good writer, and he is in many ways. His prose is run of the mill, but his dialogue some of the best I\'ve read. It isn\'t on the nose, and he slips in story in very subtle ways. However, he skips scenes he should show, and only tells about them in flashback, and he pulls away from scenes at the end just to trick the reader, which is just plain bad writing in my opinion. His characters start out as cliches -- the tomboy, the damsel, the spoiled prince, the slow giant who can only say his name, and while some of them pull away from those stereotypes, it takes hundreds and hundreds of pages for them to do it. But the worst thing about the characters is that they are mostly just a bunch of petty and foolish people, no one I would ever want to know, and certainly have no desire to read about. There are a couple interesting characters, and he does give them multiple motivations that sometimes conflict with each other in surprising ways, which is one of the commendable things I can say about him.Confusingly, some have even taken to calling him the American Tolkien. If it were not such an affront to Tolkien it would be quite laughable. What about him is anything like Tolkien? Certainly not the rape and sex scenes, or anything else I can think of. Does he buck tradition? Sure, but not in any way that enriches the tale.If your looking for plot, you should know that this story contains only the inciting incident. Most writers get further into their story the first chapter or two. Maybe the story is epic enough to warrant this, but that really depends how he handles the middle and end of the story, which I definitely won\'t be reading.If you\'re a pessimist, enjoy for fill. Otherwise you may find it a meager feast. Notable only for its subtlety, dialogue, and surprising characters.
