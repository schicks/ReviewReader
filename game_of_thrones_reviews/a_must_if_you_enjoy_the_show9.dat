I should first state that I am not a fan of the Fantasy and/or the Science/Fiction genre (I only group them together because I\u2019ve noticed that most that really love one, tend to love the other).  The only reason I read this book was, well, the same reason a lot of people read this book, and that was because they\u2019re a fan of the HBO series.  I actually never even started watching the show until after season five was over.  Like most, I was incredibly impressed with the show.Watching the show, however, contained a lot of frustrating elements if you\u2019re not a big fan of \u201cFantasy\u201d.  Where does this world exist?  What is the history?  Why do the \u201cseasons\u201d seem to last several years instead of only a few months?  Well, these are things that you really shouldn\u2019t try too hard to understand.  Doing such a thing takes away too much joy as one should just relax and be entertained.  One shouldn\u2019t worry about, when watching \u201cStar Wars\u201d for example, why \u201cThe Force\u201d can tell you when a planet is being blown up a bazillion miles away, yet it can\u2019t tell you when you\u2019re kissing your own sister.The biggest frustration when watching the show is the multitude of major and minor characters that parade in and out of the scenes.  There\u2019s so many people to keep track of, and they all have lengthy histories before the story ever even starts.  So we have to assimilate all of the different kingdoms, the different players (all with \u201cFantasy\u201d names \u2013 no Doug, Skip, or Mary), all of the arranged marriages, all the incestuous relationships, all the children born out of wedlock, etc.etc.  If you\u2019re new to the show, I would recommend watching with the Closed Caption turned on \u2013 it\u2019s really helpful to keep all of the players in order.Which is why this book is so handy and welcome.  Reading this book allows you to revisit the story that you already know, but at a slower pace.  I actually learned a lot about the characters that, while I\u2019m sure the show told me, it was in such a quick manner that it was quickly lost on me.  It\u2019s easy to follow some of the main characters \u2013 Tyrion, Eddard, Cersie, and Jamie, but when you get to all the minor ones and what their exact roles are in this epic yarn, it helps to have it all written down.  I now know, for example, a lot more about the character of Theon Greyjoy, and don\u2019t refer to him in my head only as \u201cthe guy that looks like Mick Jaggar\u201d.Still, though, even the book is weighted down with too many characters.  Fortunately, there is a handy \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d in the back of the book that aids one tremendously, but such references are quite hard to access when reading a story on an E-book, such as I did.The plot?  Well, from what I can tell, there are seven kingdoms in this fantasy world, but the kingdom of Kings Landing is the kingdom that rules overall.  Obviously, all of the kings think that they\u2019re the rightful heir to this role, so the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d consists of armies and kingdoms constantly fighting, negotiating, battling and marrying their offspring to form alliances.  It\u2019s a big complicated game, all right.  There\u2019s also some elements not familiar to our world that appear from time to time \u2013 we have dragons, white walkers, and \u201cstone\u201d people that all tend to complicate things, but make for a better overall story.The first book is essentially season one.  The book doesn\u2019t deviate much at all from the show, which I think is a good thing in this case.  As I\u2019m writing this review, there have been five books written, and five seasons of the show, so I\u2019m guessing they match up pretty evenly.Had the show not been so brilliantly done, I don\u2019t think I ever would have bothered to pick up the book, but there\u2019s a reason that the series is as highly regarded as it is.  The scenery in itself is incredibly beautiful and majestic, and the acting is first rate.  Of course, there\u2019s a lot of blood, even more violence, and even more explicit sex.  But that\u2019s HBO for you.
