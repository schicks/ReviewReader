"The Song of Fire and Ice" series is not for everyone, especially those who cling to the Tolkien model as the only appropriate approach to the genre. Nor will it do much for the Salvatore set, or the frothing hoards of Robert Jordan devotees. Martin takes a very different approach here, one that relies on the reader wanting to be defied and challenged by events and characters and on the reader\'s indulgence for moral ambiguity.There are very few characters in this book who can be called objectively evil. No evil sorcerers in black towers wringing their hands and enslaving his subjects. No glittering pure heroes destined to triumph. And absolutely no status quo. Characters speak and act like real people, with conflicting motivations and subjective morality, and without the common deux ex machina overtly saving the day.The books are also very heavy on court politics and intruige, very light on outright action. Readers should know that going in. Most of the violence is closely tied to the politics, with large-scale battles ocurring offscreen. Readers who thrive on books that move from battle to battle might be put off.In sum, these are fantasy books like no other. This is not to disparage other pulp fantasy writers, like Salvatore and Jordan, who have great chops and excel at their own version of the craft. I also don\'t want to draw the usual comparisons to Tolkien, which isn\'t really accurate at all. Martin and Tolkien have almost nothing in common apart from the fact that they are both writers. Their styles couldn\'t be more different, and the stories they both tell have almost nothing in common. Middle Earth is a world of absolutes, of identifiable good vs. identifiable evil, whereas Martin\'s is a place where there are no easily pegged absolutes.That said, Martin is a master stylist, with a firm grip on his characters and a great story to tell. The only downside to jumping on the train is the 2-3 year wait in between books. The quality of the books, however, make the wait worthwhile.
