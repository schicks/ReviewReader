I purchased the hardcover of this book two years ago. It has  collected dust until last Thursday, 10 January. Eight days and  674 pages later; I find myself in awe of Mr.Martin\'s work (A Game Of Thrones). His characters come alive in this tale- trilogy of power, corruption, lies, deceit, love, honor, valor etc.. You will find yourself cheering for any given character in one breath and forty pages later hating or despising that same character. The book and characters are NOT predicatable..a refreshing change I feverently welcome.  Trust me when I say this book is more than just a fantasy novel.  Mr. Martin has set a standard that will henceforth separate the pretenders from the contenders of literary genuis in this genre. I\'ve read Jordan and many others but in my opinion G.R.R. Martin and  Robin Hobb (Farseer Trilogy)are at the top of their craft in Epic Fantasy.  I can hardly wait to start Clash of Kings tonight; because now I realize the truth... "Winter is Coming" and when it arrives, it wont be something nice :-). I hope my words have helped sway you to partake in this reading treasure.
