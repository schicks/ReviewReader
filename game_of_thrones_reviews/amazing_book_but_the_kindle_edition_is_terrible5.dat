I won\'t review the content of this book since there are already so many good reviews.  Needless to say I love this book!This is a review specifically of the Kindle Edition.The Kindle Edition of this book is FULL of errors.  There are MANY typos and misspellings.  For instance DORNE is spelled DOME (rn looks a lot like m).  Obviously to make the Kindle Edition a copy of the book was scanned and the scanning failed in a LOT of places.Throughout the book you will find misplaced parentheses: in the middle of some words or sentences.I don\'t really want to enumerate every error so let\'s just say there are just too many errors to make reading this on the Kindle enjoyable.  Let this be a warning!
