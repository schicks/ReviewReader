Welcome to the Continent of Westeros, where noble houses maneuver for control of the seat of power known as the Iron Throne.  Follow a myriad of characters from competing factions as their fortunes rise and fall.  All the while, mysterious forces grow to threaten the rule and lives of all the competitors in the deadly game of thrones.Sounds rather exciting.  Given the popularity of the books and HBO series, most believe that it is.  I can\'t help but dissent.  As a lifelong fan of the fantasy genre (especially epic fantasy) I held high hopes for the wildly popular A Song of Ice and Fire series.  The first book left me underwhelmed, but I persisted through the second in hopes that it would catch my interest.  Alas, it did not.One failing of the book is the planning and pacing which would have Robert Jordan rolling his eyes and muttering "get on with it."  The very intriguing promise in the prologue of book 1 is promptly placed on the the back burner and never heard from again through the next two books (1500 pages).  One of the primary story threads (Daenerys) begins and remains literally a thousand miles away from interacting with any of the other characters in through two books.  But that is a quibble.  The major problem lies elsewhere.Whereas traditional fantasy tends to have clearly defined lines of good and evil, George R.R. Martin has instead set out to create a more realistic setting for his epic to take place.  A Game of Thrones would be categorized as Grimdark or Gritty fantasy.  Meaning the heroes aren\'t all that heroic, the good guys aren\'t terribly good, happy endings need not apply, and if an ugly fate awaits a character then, by the gods, they get it and then some.  While this in itself is not a problem, this is the origin of what truly goes wrong with the series, in my opinion.  While Martin set out to create "realistic" fantasy characters by stripping traditional characters of their halos and imbuing them with moral failings in order to make them more believable and relate-able, instead what he accomplished is create an entire world populated with characters that fall into one of two categories: vicious, nasty, unlikable people who can\'t die soon enough, and a precious few with some decency who inevitably have some character trait (naivete, stupidity, or what have you) that makes them easy prey to the former category, Tyrion being the lone exception.  "Oh, the last guy in charge was a backstabbing, raping, murdering sociopath?  Well meet the new guy in charge: a backstabbing, raping, murdering sociopath with a different sigil."  Eventually the entire story collapses under the weight of the realization that there is no such thing as a society which can exist where the preponderance of the population feels not a shred of moral compunction about butchering anyone and everyone they feel like at any time.  It\'s not more realistic than the simplistic fantasy where the good guys can escape any danger and have hearts of solid gold.  It\'s just as unrealistic, just in a different direction.But it is worse than that.  All suspense and surprises are nullified in such a world.  A noble stabbing another noble in the back is only shocking when honor is the generally accepted norm.  When every character is (correctly) seen to be a ruthless back-stabber-in-waiting all plot twists involving betrayals cease to be dramatic.  This is the tightrope Grimdark Fiction walks.  Give characters a side of foibles, failings, and flaws and they become more substantive, understandable, and real.  Have characters drink too deeply at the well of "grit" and you wind up with a cast of amoral, muck-covered, thugs knifing holes in each other while the audience, rather than feeling empathy toward any, nods in approval then wants to back away and find somewhere to wash their hands.By the end of Book 2, reading was chore.  I wanted to finish because I\'m a completionist, not because I actually cared about what happens to the characters.  The end of book 2 culminates in a enormous battle--where I found myself rooting for every side to annihilate the others so what\'s left of the populace could live in peace.  Failing that, a natural disaster such as a giant crack in the earth opening up and swallowing the lot of them whole would have been a satisfactory resolution for me.The emotional payoff for most novels comes in the form of a protagonist overcoming long odds and hardship to achieve some desired end.  The payoff in a Game of Thrones is to wait for the each despicable character to get their comeuppance.  It is a payoff that holds no appeal to me.
