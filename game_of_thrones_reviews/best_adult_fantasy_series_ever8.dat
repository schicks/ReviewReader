I have scanned some of the negative reviews of this book and it seems the common thread is shock over the adult content of the writing. Either that or outrage over the lack of a "fantasy" element.  It should be known that this book and this series is not G-rated Tolkien. Nor is this series a rambling fantasy epic where everyone has special powers a\' la Jordan.What this book and subsequent series happens to be is some of the best writing in the fantasy genre I have ever read.  I have been reading fantasy for over 2 decades now and have never become so engrossed in any series as I have this one. True, I was a little put off at first by the lack of the "fantasy" element - I didn\'t expect a historically based fiction novel to hold my attention - but it did, and the further on in the series you go, the more "fantasy" comes into play.I read the Jordan series up until Winter\'s Heart and enjoyed the first 6 books or so but eventually realized that the story was going nowhere.  After reading Game of Thrones and the subsequent novels I finally grasped what good writing actually is. There are no cliche\' characters in ASOIAF and no hokey actions like Nynaeve "pulling her braid" in anger.  Every major character is fully fleshed out and quite believable. The actions and reactions that lead to conflict are intelligent and understandable.  The "adult" content is not over-the-top and only adds to the immersion and believability of the world that Martin created.Admittedly, the series starts out a little slowly with this book but keep on reading and you will be glad you did. The plot twists Martin throws out are sometimes saddening and sometimes uplifting but when you finish a book you feel as if you lived it. This is by no means a feel good fantasy series where the good guy always wins and no one gets hurt. This is a novel that describes what a medevil world must really be like if thrown into conflict with unknown forces as well as other Houses.I could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself.  If you are looking for a fantasy series that will keep you yearning for the next book and if you really want to see what quality writing is like, I recommend starting with A Game of Thrones.
