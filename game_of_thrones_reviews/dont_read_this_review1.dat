Skip this review, stop reading right now.  Scroll to the top of the page  and press the order button now.Still here? Okay, I understand the need  for a little explanation.  I love fantasy.  I read Tolkien\'s Lord of the  Rings soon after the American Version was published (don\'t start counting  years on me) and I\'ve read a greet deal of the genre since.  I enjoy the  epics (Sword of Truth, Wheel of Time) and the classics but I know that they  seldom are the same.  This one is an epic that will, without a doubt, be a  classic.Okay, why?  Reason 1: Characters.  Characters so real that they  make your friends and neighbors seem like pale shadows of reality.  But  these are not the trite characters acting out predictable paths so often  seen in fantasy.  Martin knows that heroes are not always sterling  exemplars and villains are not always totally evil.  In this series I  guarantee you will find yourself, at one point, cheering on a member of the  "evil" family in his struggles.  When is the last time you did  that?Reason 2:  This is as close to reality as a fantasy can get. In  real life heroes sometimes die or commit murder in a rage.  Villains  sometimes win.  Nothing is guaranteed and if a happy ending emerges at the  end it will not be the happy ending you imagined.  One reviewer criticized  the book because the plot didn\'t go in the direction he expected.  I praise  the book for the same reason.Reason 3: Writing.  Johnny B Good played so  well that it was like he "was ringing a bell."  Martin writes  that well.  It all seems to flow out of him.  Most interestingly, he chose  to write the entire series in the first person - but that person changes  each chapter.  Normally I would find that disruptive.  But in the hands of  a master it adds a depth that has to be read to believe.  Most importantly,  it assures an identification with characters whose future is not assured.  You will read chapters with bated breath as a hero describes, in first  person, his or her life or death struggles.  In the next chapter you will  read the account of one of those who attends the hero\'s funeral.Okay,  enough.  Order the book already.
