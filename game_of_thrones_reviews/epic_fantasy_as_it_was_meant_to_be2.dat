I have been spoiled by this book, and by the subsequent books that have come out in this series.I am now completely unable to read a fantasy book without comparing its level of quality with that of A Song of Ice and Fire, and, sadly enough, very few compare at all.Everything about this series rings true: the characters, the complicated plot, the prose, the action, the dialogue.For those readers who are looking for a \'light\' read, do not pick up this book. I can understand that sometimes a heavy epic is just too much, especially after having finished another (I know how it is to try and read ANYTHING after flogging through the tenth Robert Jordan). But if you are looking for epic fantasy that is not simply \'good v. evil\' or \'hero who knows nothing about the world, yet ends up saving it,\' please give this book a try.The characters are fully fleshed, with actual personalities. They are not \'good\' or \'evil\' but a little of both within themselves. There is no such thing as an \'invincible\' character. All these characters are human, with human needs, thoughts, desires, lives, and decisions to make.The plot is not convoluted; it is complex. There is a difference. And it is not a lighthearted fantasy. There is darkness and evil here that has nothing to do with magic, but is instead related to the pitfalls of the human nature.Please, please, if you wish Robert Jordan would wrap the hell up, if you love Robin Hobb and thought that Terry Brooks\' first book was a disaster of hackneyed prose and ripped-off characters -- please, please try this book. It is well worth your while.
