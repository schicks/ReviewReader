Rather than call this a fantasy book for adults I would like to think of this as a fantasy book for people who think.  There is a difference.I read with some surprise some of the more critical reviews of \ufffdA Game of Thrones\ufffd there were complaints of graphic sex scenes and gratuitous violence.  I couldn\ufffdt find any graphic sex scenes.  Sex was presented but it was not graphic or gratuitous, I thought it was a little refreshing; far too many fantasy books avoid sex like the plague.  I also found far less violence in this book than in most other fantasy novels where anything that is inhuman or ugly is hacked apart with massive swords by the beautiful people.The book is about politics, which sounds horrifically boring but is presented in such a way as to make the intricacies of court and the multitude of players become vivid and real.  \ufffdA Game of Thrones\ufffd tells an epic tale of honor and treachery, love and vengeful hatred, intrigue and heroism set in a world where summers and winters can last for years, even lifetimes.  The main story line involves Eddard Stark, lord of Winterfell, and his investigation into the death of another noble.  Along the way there are dozens of interwoven plots, subplots and fascinating characters.This is not a book about conflict between the elemental forces of good and evil.  Rather than a drab world of black and white  Mr. Martin has opted for a more realistic world of grays and innumerable colors.  Rather than having simplified reasoning for actions the characters all have understandable motives or at least understandable rationalizations for their actions.  This is a feature lacking in 95% of other fiction I have read.\ufffdA Game of Thrones\ufffd is filled with interesting, fully fleshed out characters.  I searched in vane for cardboard or clich\xe9d characters and every time I thought I found one I was proven wrong as these characters developed and grew in front of my eyes.Attention to detail in creating the Kingdom of Westeros is remarkable. Westeros is a large island off the coast of the main continent (Think the British Isles) that was at one time divided into seven separate kingdoms but in present day is united under the banner of a single King.  These individual domains all have their particular customs, traditions and ruling classes.  The history of this land is presented with great care, one never feels lectured at or bored with background detail provided.Magic is happily kept to a minimum.  This is a book about people and politics and intrigue, not about wizards tossing around bolts of lightning.  The minimal placement of magic and fantastic beings in the book serves to make their appearance all the more interesting and also serves to carry the story forward rather than solve all the character\ufffds problems with a wave of the hand.I have the second and third installments of the series and am looking forward to the fourth book, reportedly due out in 2003
