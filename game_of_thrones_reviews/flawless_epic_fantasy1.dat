Let me start by saying that I am NOT a Robert Jordan fan. In my opinion, the characters are flat, it takes him four or five entire volumes to do a decent amount of character development, and the story never seems to go anywhere. That being said, A Song Of Ice And Fire (the title for this epic) blows The Wheel Of Time completely out of the water. You can almost imagine Jordan bowing down at Martin\'s feet to pay him homage...the setting is incredibly well-developed and fleshed out, every single character is unique and thought out, the story is well-paced, and it never seems to slow down. I can also happily report, being about halfway through A Storm Of Swords (the third book in the series) that it keeps getting better! Martin manages to shock his audience by never stooping in the quality of his work...the story continues to move along at a nice pace, and I just haven\'t been able to put these books down. One thing I should say however, particularly for the benefit of parents...in an effort to make the world of A Song Of Ice And Fire more realistic (an effort at which Martin succeeds on an unprecedented scale), the writer has included a significant amount of graphic, adult content...including incest, strong sexual themes, and violence often described in gory detail. This is not a complaint; I really thought that these themes only helped add to the story\'s effect (hey, war ain\'t pretty, folks), but I always think it\'s good that parents receive a \'heads-up\' if they are thinking of buying this book for their children. All in all, an amazing piece of work, and a breath of fresh air for the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone.
