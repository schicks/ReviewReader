I just had to write a review for this book. I consider myself a casual reader and I\'ll admit I haven\'t read many other high fantasty books in my time and yet, this is quite honestly THE most well written book I have ever read, bar none. If you stick with this book (beginning is a little slow imho) you will agree with me. So if you are a casual reader or die-hard you have got to give this book a shot.
