Okay so the book has been out for a *while* and there have been lots of reviews, but wanted to add my thumb\'s up as well.I\'ve been buying the books since they were released, telling myself that I would read them all once the series was finished since I didn\'t want to have to reread between books. I finally gave in and read this because of the HBO series, which I am really enjoying. Enjoying so much that I was happily picturing the images from the show as I was reading the book. I didn\'t want the show to get ahead of me so I finished the book tonight.By now you\'ve heard a lot about the series - and it\'s true, there are many diverse plots and story lines. Although it\'s almost 900 pages, there is not a wasted word - the action is steady and the book a page-turner, especially by  midpoint when I could not put it down.I have long been a fan of high fantasy novels, and one of my favorite authors is Guy Gavriel Kay and his fantastic novel\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Tigana/dp/0451457765">Tigana</a>\xa0One of the things I like about Kay\'s novels is that the magic is not used as deus ex machina - the characters have to use their wits to get out of trouble. In fact there is not a lot of magic in these books, although there is some with lots of prophesy and foreshadowing.But don\'t assume that this prophesy and foreshadowing means you will know what will happen -  you won\'t. There are lots of intriguing and surprising plots twists and turns in this book, and no one is safe.Add to the action and intrigue is lots of humor, brought to you by a dwarf named Tyrian. He may be my favorite character in the book, and that\'s saying a lot.Highly recommended.  Obviously.*forgot to add that I read some comments that people had problems with the Kindle edition - maybe they\'ve fixed them because I read this on my Kindle and it was just fine.
