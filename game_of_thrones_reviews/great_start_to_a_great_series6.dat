George Martin doesn\'t just tell his readers a story, he grabs them by the back of the neck and yanks them into his world.  The characters are so real, you\'ll think you\'ve known them for years.  At least until they completely shock you, which happens throughout.  The plot is intricate and it MOVES!  The intrigue begins on page one, then twists and builds all the way to the end.A word of warning to avid fantasy readers.  This book (and the series in general) is not loaded with magic swords, powerful rings, or hidden spellbooks.  Magic provides some of the back story and does cast a shadow on present events, but not much more than that in this first book.  The role of magic does expand somewhat in the sequels, however.If you want to read a gripping story featuring complex, three-dimensional characters in a fascinating, well-conceived world, check this book out.  I\'ve read fantasy from Tolkien, Donaldson, and Jordan to Wolfe, Willaims, and Goodkind, and "A Game of Thrones" more than holds its own.  You WON\'T be disappointed!
