The first installment of A Song of Ice and Fire reveals Martin\'s genius in creating a feudal society and the political machinations that went on behind the scenes.  The end result is that everything seems real...and it is  only when a direwolf or other non-earth creature appears that you remember  that this is not a (wonderfully done) recreation of European history,  Hadrian\'s wall and all.  (But then again, maybe it is!) His characters come  in so many assortments and with so much psychological depth that there is  always something new, something deeper to discover about an individual and  there is always someone you love to hate or to mourn with.  An author who  can do that on the scale that Martin does is truly a dedicated, talented,  hardworking author, and every page reveals that Martin is just that.  The  writing is superbly crafted, the situations and plot carefully and  intricately developed.  The book is full of many surprises and developments  that kept me unable to put it down, and I awaited the 2nd volume with much  anticipation and I\'ll read the 3rd as soon as it comes out.  This book  truly earned its 5 stars.
