Over the last 30 years almost every series in the fantasy genre is the Lord of the Rings told with different characters in a different setting. Jordan and Eddings are just 2 big name authors who\'ve made money on  retelling the same kind of story.  George Martin has changed the look of  fantasy with his first installment of this series.  The book isn\'t your  typical fantasy novel about a young hero setting out on a long journey that  will save the world.  Its about something that happened 1000 years ago.  Its about people fighting over the crown of a powerful kingdom, stopping at  nothing to try and achieve their goal.  This is going to be what authors  will model their work after over the next few decades like they have been  doing since the Lord of the Rings.  Its the most pwerful book I\'ve ever  read in my life surpassing all these other authors.  He writes about humans  going for real goals, not saving the universe from the ultimate evil.  The  characters are real, the plot believeable, and not one page is wasted.
