NB: THIS REVIEW REFERS TO THE KINDLE EDITION ALONE!  This is a great book, and I\'ve eaten up the series and have been on tenterhooks for George RR to get his finger out and publish A Dance with Dragons for YEARS now.  (And the tv series!! Be still my beating heart!!!)  But I have to comment on the extremely bad editing of the Kindle edition of A Game of Thrones.  It is sloppy and unprofessional.  When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse.  I thought Sacajawea was bad, but A Game of Thrones starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into the book.  People who only read the kindle edition will think that Princess Elia comes from Dome, since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout the book.  (It\'s Dorne).  But on the other hand, the `tom cat\' is a `torn cat\'- go figure.  Little things like that at first, but now, in the last third of the book, the mistakes are coming on nearly every page.  Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing.  It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in a free edition of a book (maybe).  But for a Kindle book that costs more than the paperback, I expect more.  I also own a hard copy of this book, and none of these typos are in that edition.  I\'m not sure how the Kindle editions are made, but I expect the same kind of professional editing that you get in print books.  You don\'t get that here, disappointingly.
