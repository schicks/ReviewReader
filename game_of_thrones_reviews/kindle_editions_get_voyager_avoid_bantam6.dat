I won\'t comment about the story of this great, gripping, 5-star book: I just want to clarify one thing about the Kindle editions (there are two), since there are many reviewers recommending to avoid "the Kindle Edition" altogether. I bought both of them, and what I have to say is that the kindle edition you should avoid is Bantam\'s [..], which is shamefully riddled with typos (some of them: "Dome", "torncat", "s word", "sept on", "arid" instead of "Dorne", "tomcat", "sword", "septon" and "and"). The Voyager edition, though, is much, much better (not only with none or few typos, but also with a table of contents and more maps).
