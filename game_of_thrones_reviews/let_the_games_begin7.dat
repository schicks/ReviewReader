If you\'re going to consider reading `The Song of Ice and Fire\' series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren\'t for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring a great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters\' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Games of Thrones is able to deliver a very deep story targeting a mature audience because of this, though this also means the book\'s level of comprehension and adult content may become a deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you\'ll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.As I previously said, the narrative of A Game of Thrones can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn\'t exactly paint a very big picture of what\'s to come. So I\'ve decided to provide a brief synopsis of my own.With the murder of King Robert Baratheon\'s Hand `Jon Aryn\', his Majesty himself has requested that his old friend Eddard Stark, head of House Stark take up the role at his side in King\'s Landing to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Eddard, `Ned\' must leave the sanctity of Winterfell and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Lannister family. The book doesn\'t just follow the character Ned, but rather a large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Ned, others involve their own. Daenerys Targaryen, one of the last of the feared House Targaryen, is forced into a marriage with a savage Dothraki warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Ned\'s bastard son `Jon Snow\' and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night\'s Watch\', where desertion is punishable by death.While the plot of A Game of Thrones is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren\'t believable. George R. R. Martin has established himself as a very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Eddard Stark, the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Starks and the Lannisters. The Starks characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They\'re opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Lannister family, who seem like Martin\'s equivalent of the Borgia\'s. Though if there\'s a weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Lannister family. The Stark family makes up the bulk of the story\'s protagonists, but they aren\'t exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they\'re delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Lannister\', we\'re given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Lannisters, while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Stark family.In a seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Starks, particularly the Stark children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they\'re among the victims in this malicious game that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent.Even the world itself feels like a character that helps ground the reader in the author\'s fiction. Martin\'s `Seven Kingdoms\' are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader a feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Martin\'s world a pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the `White Walkers\' and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is a fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Seven Kingdoms feels like a realm that very much could have existed. It\'s an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.There\'s going to be the inevitable comparison between Martin\'s work and the legacy left behind by Tolkien as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Martin\'s writing is completely different from Tolkien\'s in nearly every angle. Tolkien emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in a fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Martin on the other hand is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable\', while others stand atop a pedestal as paragons of altruism.  But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they\'re ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Martin chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They\'re not the great heroes Tolkien illustrated; they\'re morally ambiguous human beings. That\'s the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Martin isn\'t trying to replicate Tolkien but rather make his own beast.Yet, I never like to jump on a bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that a novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I\'m not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they\'re all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I\'m referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn\'t mention this, but with a book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of a proper climax to the story. I\'m all for having an intriguing plot over a mindless slog of action scenes, but with a book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with a bang. It\'s little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Harry Potter novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of a skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating a television show made me raise an eyebrow, "instead of making a movie they\'re going to milk it with a whole season of episodes" I thought. After reading A Game of Thrones, I realized that making a television show out of the book isn\'t just a good idea, it\'s absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that a movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It\'s the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don\'t exactly have many of those.A Game of Thrones is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate George R. R. Martin\'s natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.
