<a class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Game-of-Thrones/dp/B000QCS8TW">A Game of Thrones</a>I just finished the Kindle version of Game of Thrones.  The story is epic and I loved it.  There is  a problem though, it was full of all types of typos, grammatical errors, and spelling errors.Normally I don\'t notice stuff like this much.  For me to comment on it means it\'s pretty bad.  Someone like my friend Raven would implode trying to read it.Here are a couple of examples; There is a character called Dany for short.  In on sentence she is Daily. In one section,  \'if\' was \'jf\'. There were many many more  I\'m about to start Clash of Kings.  I hope it has better editing. I wonder if this was just a Kindle thing?V^^^^V
