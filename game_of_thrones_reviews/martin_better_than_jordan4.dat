As a relatively new reader of sci-fi and fantasy, I hadn\'t read too many of the current popular fantasy series, so I started with Jordan\'s books.  While they were enthralling and the world he builds is amazingly detailed,  my foray into the Seven Kingdoms in George R. R. Martin\'s A Song of Ice and  Fire series has been just as enjoyable.  I can\'t decide my favorite of the  two authors, but I will tell you what I like about A Game of  Thrones.First observation:  Things happen.  After reading entire  chapters of Jordan\'s later novels that only stew in their own contemplative  juices without actually going anywhere, it was refreshing to experience a  little adventure and excitement with each chapter in AGOT.Second  observation:  Women are authentic.  I\'m not sure if I phrased that  properly, but here\'s what I mean.  After a while, Jordan\'s portrayal of  women gets really annoying.  Maybe it\'s just me, but they all seem so  similar and uninteresting most of the time.  In AGOT the female characters  are some of my favorites and they seem like real people to me.I hope  that anyone who is reading this looking for a potential fantasy novel to  bide their time until the next Jordan book comes out will immediately add  this worthy tome to their shopping cart.  You may find yourself counting  the days until the next Martin book rather than the next Jordan book if  you\'re not careful.
