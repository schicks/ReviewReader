I\'d heard wonderful things about the series, some even going so far as to warn me, "You will never be able to enjoy another series of books with the same fervor because those books are THAT good." It is so true that the minute I finished reading a A Game of Thrones, I headed to the Kindle Store to download A Clash of Kings.The very first chapter of this book sucked me in with a chilling promise of fretful darkness in a world where you can\'t just turn on the lights to get away from the shadows. Set in a time and place not unlike medieval Europe, the narrative is divided chapter by chapter, allowing us to enter into several of the book\'s critical characters and follow the thread of their journey. As difficult as it might seem to take us on this trip through the eyes of at least nine different characters, Martin manages to weave the entire story together fluidly, and not once did I find myself feeling lost or confused when the POV shifted with a new chapter.Every character that lent voice to the story drew me into their world and made me feel for them, even the dwarf Tyrion Lannister, with his dark view and blatant honesty in a world all-to-unwilling to see the truth. Bran Stark became a favorite character early on, as I watched the world grow dark and tainted to his child\'s eyes, but failed to snuff the flame of the adventurer inside him. I quickly fell in love with Princess Daenerys Targaryen, whose older brother pushed her around all her life, threatening and mistreating her until she rose and found the power of the dragon inside her.By and large, A Game of Thrones is one of the best books I\'ve read since finishing Marion Zimmer Bradley\'s The Mists of Avalon many, many years ago. It is a book I will read over and again for the rest of my life, just for the pleasure of revisiting old friends and living through their adventures with them again.Five out of Five Stars without hesitation.
