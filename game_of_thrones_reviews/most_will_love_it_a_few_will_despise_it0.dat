This book single handedly renewed my faith in the fantasy genre and showed that there are still new things that can be done with the medium.If you have grown weary of the story of a farmboy/farmgirl with hidden magical powers and a secret lineage who travels across the land with his/her trusty band of sterotype heroes to do battle with the minions of some evil lord hereby saving the world, then by all means get this book and read it!If, on the other hand, that type of plot device is what you crave and you can\'t get enough of the virtuous warrior or reluctant mage and his gruff dwarf and cutesy halfling buddies, then stay away from Game of Thrones - there is none of that in here.  As one reviewer put it, "Where are the heroes?" - thankfully far away!!What is here are characters who blur the line between good and evil, completely unforeseen plot twist, realistic motivations and consequences, political intrigue and a setting that comes to life.I have always taking a liking to the non-traditional fantasy and those stories whose central figures are anti-heroes or those on a path of redemption.  This book in many ways reminds of what I liked best about authors such as Moorcock, Gemmell and Leiber.If, like me, you seek some non-traditional fantasy of a truly epic proportion that goes light on the elves, dwarves and knights in shining armor then you too will probably love this book!
