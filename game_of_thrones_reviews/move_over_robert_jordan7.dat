As a fantasy reader of somewhat high standards, I have always had a proclivity for "epic" fantasy.  Nothing else really satisfies my desire for an absorbing story.  George R.R. Martin has, with this book, taken the field dominated by such giants as Jordan, Williams, and Kay and blown a great big gust of fresh air into it.  Not only does this book have the complicated plot and intricate character development that is common to these three talented authors, but it has a certain brutal realism to it.  Granted, we\'re talking about an invented realm, but never before in all the books that I have read has any author taken his portrayal of all the brutality of human nature to this level.  Part of what makes Jordan, Williams, and Kay so brilliant is that they write *human* characters, and good and bad are rarely well delineated.  What sets Martin apart is his sheer, brutal, mind-numbing honesty.  He doesn\'t pull any punches, and neither do any of his characters.  This ! is life, in all its pain and glory.  Honor is not as important as we would like it to be, and things do not all go well as long as we wish for it hard enough.  Here, there is no destructive force stronger than the power of men.  There is no evil greather than that in the hearts of men.  And there is no power, once man has decided to destroy, that can stop him.  This novel is a masterpiece; beautifully crafted, shockingly realistic, and a joy to read.  However, don\'t expect to come out of reading this with your ideals intact.
