The wonder of this game is matched only by it\'s complexity. To compare it\'s similarites with Risk, the only other strategy board game I have played, is to say they both have armies. The differences then take flight with an innovative battle system which involves no luck only strategy, ships to give a whole new element to consider with the transport and aid they offer, a system of bidding for three seperate offices which greatly affect the players ablities to operate on the field of battle. Consider before purchusing the depth of the game, as not only dose it take time to memorize the rules but the game itself takes time to set up with its many pieces. Yet there is no board game I have ever played that rewards skill rather than chance the way this one dose. Simple games are fun to pass the time, but to play A Game Of Thrones is a rich and rewarding exsperiance. All in all it takes one game to fully comprehend the game and it\'s workings and after that things go much smoother as exsperiance grows. To me worth every cent.
