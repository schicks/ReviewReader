I write as a Dominican friar and teacher of Scripture (and formerly of literature) in Rome.  I found Martin\'s book fascinating.  At first the disconnected narratives are hard to follow.  Then you realize that you\'re  in the same world as "War and Peace" -- families that interact  against the backdrop of larger events.  I detect the influence of Herodotus  (his description of the Scythians) and "The Golden Bough".  For  those who want humanity to be nice, this is not a nice book, but it  represents a wonderful re-presentation of the epic spirit in western  literature.  The characters are well-drawn and in many cases  well-developed.  The shifting of perspective may be disconcerting but the  author shows a distinct bias in favor of honest, honorable characters,  however gruesome their fates may be.  A comparison with Tolkien is silly;  this is a different type of epic.  My only hope is that it not succumb to  being drawn out to the length of  Jordan\'s interminable Wheel of Time.
