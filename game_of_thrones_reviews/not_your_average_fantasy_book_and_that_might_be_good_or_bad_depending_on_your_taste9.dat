There is something everyone who is thinking about reading this series should know, IT ISN\'T YOUR TYPICAL FANTASY NOVEL. Is that a good thing, you ask? Well, maybe.****************************************You might like this book if . . .****************************************1. You would rather read about political manipulations than fighting and war-mongering.2. Very graphic sex scenes do not bother you.3. You do not require lots of magic in your stories.4. You enjoy well developed, detailed characters who tend to have fatal character flaws.5. You like a very long, very in-depth mystery6. You don\'t mind reading about the "grit" of medival life. Nothing is sugar coated here, rest assured of that.7. You don\'t mind not having a central character to root for.****************************************You will hate this book if . . .****************************************1. You expect a fantasy novel to have lots of fantasy in it.2. If 15 pages of action out of 200 is not ok with you.3. Very detailed sexual exploits offend you.4. You want to really care about a character or need someone to root for.5. You don\'t like really long stories (if an 800 page book makes you shudder, this one isn\'t for you because it only gets worse)6. Similar sounding names infuriate you.7. You don\'t mind keeping up with 8+ plot lines and 20+ major characters.*****Magic*****There isn\'t a whole lot of magic in this world. Especially when compared to something like Harry Potter in which everything up to, and including, the crapper is magical. Here is a list of just about everything magical I could find:1. Ancient tree spirits2. Ancient undead . . . things3. Extra long seasons. A typical round of seasons might look like this: summer lasts 7 years, fall last 3 years, winter last 5 years, spring last 4 years, summer last 4 years, fall last 6 years, etc.4. Children grow up faster. From the way the story is written (he never explicitly says one way or another) we can conclude that children reach maturity much sooner than "real" people do. So, a 15 year old boy is equal to a 18 or 19 year old "real" boy. Likewise a 13 year old girl is equal to a 16 or 17 year old "real" girl. It is a little odd but you get use to it.*****Characters*****Many of the characters are either stock, evil or borrowed from some other pieces of fiction. There are several who are "good", many who are "bad" and a handful whom are "indifferent". Yet, in spite of all of that it is easy believe that they are real. Martin does a good job of making them seem lifelife. So, even if you think you have seen them before they are still crafted nicely here. There aren\'t that many truly unique characters though and no one exists as "The Hero".*****Action*****Very limited action considering the amount of story telling that goes on. There is a tournament, a war, lots of brawling and the occasional fist fight. If you need lots of adventure go buy a comic book because this isn\'t for you.*****Plot*****This is a very plot driven story. The plot is interesting, don\'t get me wrong, but it can get a little tiring at points. Most of the time you will try and unravel the many mysterys laid before you and thus won\'t notice (too much) that the book is really long. Now, I am not against long books, provided there is a point to all that length. Writing just to fill space annoys me though. And while Martin is interesting, and descriptive, there are times when I think an editor should have gone though this thing a little harder than he originally did.So, overall, do I recomend this book? Sort of. If you can get past the lack of action and magic then this isn\'t too bad of a book. Here is an interesting note, though. If Martin had taken out the 4 somewhat magical elements of this book, changed the setting to medieval Europe and modified a few names, then this could easily sit on the "Fictional History" shelf.
