1) I can\'t see how this classifies as "fantasy" since there exists no magic or supernatural aspects except in deep corners of the book; nothing like a main aspect like in LOTR or Dune or Harry Potter where magic and supernatural are a huge part of the story. If anything, this is just medieval fiction. The ONLY thing "fantasy" in this book is dragons and they\'re extinct. There are some creatures called the Others, but they exist beyond a wall and, surprise surprise, NO ONE GOES THERE! So 90% of the book is in this mock medieval world/timeline...how is that fantasy?2) Too many characters. It\'s easy to keep track of the main characters but all of the other characters get lost and you have to keep figuring out who everyone is. And for many characters, like Sansa, who cares about her and what she thinks? She serves no purpose, than after a certain event (no spoilers) Joffrey just beats her around; why do i want to read about a minor character of no importance to the story? Space waster.3) Too slow of pace. I\'m 350 pages in and very little has happened. A kid got attacked, and almost attacked a second time...that\'s it. One could argue that the story is drawn on to seem realistic in regards to say Ned Stark\'s investigation about his kid and the death of Jon Arryn, but with the viewpoints and stories of other characters included (often not relative to the investigation) it makes the story really, really, long and slow. People don\'t read books for the realistic timeline, they read for entertainment; why do you think shows like CSI solve ALL crimes in an hour? Because no one would watch if they treated cases realistically that sometimes go for months, years, or are never solved.4) One of my biggest peeves with "Girl with the dragon tattoo" was that there were two story lines that took forever to merge (Mikael\'s and Salanders). In Game of Thrones this story line of Dany and the Dothraki keeps popping up that apparently is on a totally different continent than the rest of the book; yet only once in the 350 pages I\'ve read has there been any hint of the Dothraki story line merging with the rest of the book: one character worries about Dany Taergaryan getting an arming and marching for the thrown....but oh wait, the Dothraki hate water and have no boats  so let\'s not worry about them. Book continues with two separate non-merging story lines. Keeping track of all the characters and story lines until some big merge of all of them is too much work. I don\'t want to see how the pizza is made, i just want to eat it.5) GRR Martin is a creepy old man. Ned Stark and his wife are the only people who have normal, happy, in-love/care about the other person sex. The rest of the sex in the book is widely disturbing: Rape, Incest, Prostitution/sex slavery, and underage sex (Dany is only 13. AND somehow after the first time becomes an instant pro at it; yeah, that\'s realistic just like the breasts of every woman in video games). The "excuse" i hear from so many is "it\'s accurate for the time period"...wait, is Martin writing historical fiction or fantasy? LOTR was set in a similar time period and isn\'t full of rape, incest, prostitution/sex slavery, and underage sex...so what\'s the deal?I kept hearing that Game of Thrones was so awesome and i saw the 1st book for like $9 so i thought "why not"...perhaps it\'s just my anti-conformist but this book is overrated. My rule is that if a book doesn\'t grab me 100 pages i stop reading. I went to 350 only because the book is so big (didn\'t see how many pages total) and it\'s a serious let down
