I\'m obviously one of the very few fantasy fans who didn\'t like this book based on the other reviews I\'ve read for this book.  Something about this book just didn\'t work for me, however.Most of the reviews detail the realistic characters and numerous plot twists as one of the great things about this book, but that\'s what I saw as this book\'s downfall.I found myself disliking if not flat out despising nearly every character in this book.  Every one of them had serious flaws, be it that they were flat-out scumbags, selfish nobles, or just too dense to do what they should.  This may be realistic, but I guess I read fantasy looking to enjoy the story of a hero, not to follow along as character after character shows they\'re not worthy of being a hero.The number of plot twists left me a little bewildered too.  I found myself struggling to keep everything in perspective, as characters I thought were going to be part of the main story suddenly died, leaving me wondering what just happened and why.  Was I misreading the earlier part of the book by thinking they were better than they turned out to be?  Maybe if I could have forced myself to continue the series it would have made more sense, but after reading this book, I just kind of felt like I couldn\'t bear any more frustration.So I\'d have to say, be very careful if you decide to read this book.  You\'ll see tons of reviews that declare this book and it\'s follow-ups to be the greatest there is in fantasy literature.  Just be prepared to lose numerous characters you liked, and not enough of the ones you didn\'t, along the way.  It\'s easily the most realistic book I\'ve read in the fantasy genre (that was good enough to make me finish the book, any way), but that doesn\'t make it the best by any stretch.
