The world of Westeros, the setting for A Song of Ire and Fire, contains the perfect balance of realism and magic that has been missing in the genre for some time (are you listening Forgotten Realms editors?).  We find moral ambiguity and the constant and real threat of an untimely demise, even for the most important characters.  The characters are well-nuanced, with real motives and human passions.  Magic is reserved for the few and, when it manifests, it does so in incredible displays of power.I labeled Martin\'s prose "raw" and "reckless" because he does not appear to be afraid of any theme or issue and he turns many conventional fantasy elements on their collective heads.  Martin, quite simply, is the best fantasy author since Moorcock.A warning:  don\'t buy this book unless you are prepared to purchase the entire series.  The books are, at once, compelling and addictive page-turners that will leave you clamoring for more.
