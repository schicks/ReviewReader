After seeing the previews for Game of Thrones on HBO in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, Game of Thrones looked like your typical Medieval times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was somewhat disinterested...until a few days before the premier I happened to catch a making-of Game of Thrones production. So I set my DVR and I\'m glad that I did. Game of Thrones was one of the best things on TV in 2011. It was so good that I purchased the book to get the source\'s perspective, and after finishing the book I\'d say that the HBO adaptation of Game of Thrones kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties.It was great to read the book after seeing the show to be able to put faces with all of the names. The standout descrepany from book to screen is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in a book it\'s okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly HBO thought a lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct.Game of Thrones is a very long read with a ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequrent books it\'s a common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this first in the series and I\'m a few chapters into the second in the series called A Clash of Kings.Game of Thones sets the stage for the rest of the epic series and introduces what I\'m guessing will be the key players. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you\'d have thought would "never die" by the end of Game of Thrones. What\'s clear is that war lies in the future and the book details the violent struggles among the land\'s controlling families and kingdoms. And as there will evidently be more than just human encounters to deal with in the struggles for power as A Clash of Kings and the rest of the story unfolds.I\'m hooked on A Song of Ice and Fire, and I\'ll be done with Clash of Kings prior to the second HBO season which is a nice reversal of order. Don\'t miss this series if you\'re into the action/fantasy genre.
