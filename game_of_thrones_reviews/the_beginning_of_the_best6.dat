A Game of Thrones is the first installement of the best fantasy series I\'ve read so far.  It is character driven fantasy at its best: all of the characters are unique, they grow and change, and, most importantly, they\'re believable.  Indeed, this book reads more like a work of historical fiction than any other fantasy title I\'ve read.  It is Martin\'s daring choices throughout the novel that gives it its greatest strength.Unlike most other fantasy titles, magic and fantastic creatures have a very little part to play.  There are no spell-slinging wizards, or magic swords, or goblins, or any of the other staple ingredients of most fantasy novels.  The most fantastic part of this fantasy is the nature of the world\'s seasons.  Summers and winters can last for years, even decades.  And as those of House Stark say, winter is coming....As remarkable as Martin\'s non-fantastic fantasy setting is, it is his deft control over the characters that is most worthy of praise.  Every character, from Lord Eddard Stark to a random innkeeper, is interesting.  They are, for lack of a better word, alive.  Martin writes so wonderfully that it is hard not to think the characters are sitting nearby telling you this marvellous tale.  Martin doesn\'t get too wrapped up in the well-being of those characters, however.  Unlike most other fantasy authors, Martin is willing (and able) to kill off major characters.  Indeed, it is a wonderful shock to see an author that celebrates his characters by proving once and again that they are mortal.  He does not kill more than he needs to in order to tell the tale.  Indeed, the best way I can put it is like this:There is no main protagonist, nor is there a promenent antagonist.  The story, rather, is THE character of the novel.  And I wouldn\'t have it any other way.
