In the world of fantasy literature, there are a few massive, seemingly unending epics whose authors\' names we hear time and time again, and rightly so. To craft a work so colossal in scope is a daunting task, and few can pull it off. At the top of a short list stands George R. R. Martin, author of the "Song of Ice and Fire" series. These books avoid several pitfalls of the fantasy genre that many others cannot.First, it\'s refreshing to read a high fantasy with a plot that doesn\'t hinge on one Ultimate Bad Guy who\'s bent on destroying the entire world for motives that are hackneyed, dubious, or simply omitted. Such fantasies can certainly be interesting, but we all know how they will end: within the first hundred pages of the first book, we know who the invincible hero is, and we know that he will live to fight and defeat the Ultimate Bad Guy on page 996 of the last book. The conflict that begins to unfold in Martin\'s "A Game of Thrones" is much more real, and more believable. It is multifaceted as well; by the second book in the series, there are not two sides to the conflict, but six. Furthermore, the sides are not so clearly defined. There are certainly virtuous and villainous characters to be found, but often honor hides behind a mask of darkness, and treachery beats in the hearts of heroes. And things only get better as the series goes on, which may seem unbelievable to those of us who have been waiting for six years for something, anything to happen in Jordan\'s stagnating "Wheel of Time."I\'ve always been a fan of magic in fantasy novels, but "A Game of Thrones" is predominantly a military fantasy where its battles are concerned, and I find myself enjoying the break from the status quo. Magic and the supernatural are not absent from this series -- they do surface later on -- but they are otherworldly, alien. It\'s often mentioned in other fantasy worlds that commoners distrust magic because they don\'t understand it, and I find it interesting to be sharing their point of view for once. Martin doesn\'t need magic to craft a peerless tale.There is also a much greater focus on political intrigue than you\'d normally expect to find in a book of this nature, and it\'s truly fascinating and well-done. The constant maneuvering and double-dealings in this book keep the story moving in ways you won\'t guess; this is perhaps the least predictable of all the many fantasies I\'ve read. Events that you think are unavoidable may not turn out at all as you\'d imagined, and characters you were sure would live forever can meet a tragic twist of fate at any time. Sudden attacks and surprises lose some of their appeal in other novels when you know for certain who will survive; such is not the case in Martin\'s book.The dialogue is well above average for the genre as well. It happens too often that fantasy characters are constantly given lines that no one would ever speak aloud, but Martin\'s dialogue is much better. Tyrion, especially, is so much fun to read; I often find myself laughing at his jokes.Finally, the world that Martin has constructed is instantly believable and exquisitely detailed. A painstakingly crafted history is evident from the first pages of the book, and makes everything more believable, from the world itself to the motivations of its characters. The Seven Kingdoms look a lot more like a place that might actually exist than a romanticized vision of medieval times.I can\'t imagine what anyone would hold against this book. There are a ton of names and events to follow, but if you\'re a fan of fantasy, that should be nothing new. And the appendix helps if you get lost. For those of you who are tired of predictable plots and stereotypical characters, for those of you who are tired of fantasy series that start strong and then go nowhere, pick up "A Game of Thrones," and never look back.
