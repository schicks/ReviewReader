George R.R. Martin has been feted as Tolkien\'s successor in TIME Magazine and in newspapers, heralded by his fans as being better than Robert Jordan, and all the accolades inspired a jaundiced attitude in me as I read "A Game Of Thrones."  I will say this:  it\'s nowhere as bad as anything by Jordan or David Eddings, both of whom write on a 7th-grade level with flat characters.  I couldn\'t finish either of the novels I started that were written by the forenamed authors.  But I finished "A Game Of Thrones" and look forward to the rest of Martin\'s series.Why, because the man\'s press is true?  Well, no, it isn\'t.  Martin is better than Jordan and Eddings, but that\'s like comparing the junior high valedictorian to the rest of his class.  His writing is brisk, gets the story moving, flows well; it\'s also pedestrian, and I doubt there are any phrases that\'ll stick to mind when I\'m finished with his series.  He doesn\'t seem to have much love or regard for language.So is he Tolkien\'s heir in spite of this?  No, because, in spite of the fact that Tolkien\'s language is antique and often overdone, Tolkien was a master at worldbuilding.  Most Tolkien fans would love to find Middle-earth.  I wouldn\'t pay two cents for a stay in the Seven Kingdoms if I had dragons for bodyguards; it\'s a cold, unpleasant place.  But Martin brings it to life, which makes him a superior storyteller to Eddings, Jordan and company.Did I like the story?  Yes, in spite of the fact that it\'s a retelling of the Wars of the Roses.  I rather suspect I know who\'ll win in the end.  I\'ve gotten attached to certain characters-Jon, Bran, Arya, Tyrion, Daenerys, Sandor Clegane and, oddly, Loras Tyrell-and hate others (Cersei, Catelyn, Sansa, Gregor Clegane, Janos Slynt, almost anybody named Lannister or connected to them, Alliser Thorne).  The language is blunt; so are the situations.  I\'m grateful.  Enough fantasy is whitewashed and Disneyized; thank goodness Martin shows a medieval world so real you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices."Song of Ice And Fire" is not a masterwork, but it\'s a good read.  And it looks as if it will have a real conclusion.  I\'ll stick with it until I find something better or it ends.
