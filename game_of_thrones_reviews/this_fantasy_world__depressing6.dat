Like many others, I started this book trying to find out what all the hype was about. It was recommended to me by an author I know and respect. Anyway...not my cup of tea. I won\'t give you a synopsis because those are easily found elsewhere. My friend described it as a chess game, and that is very apt, I think.Things I liked:1. The writing is certainly competent prose. No problem there.2. The fantasy world it is set in is fascinating, different enough from others that it piques the interest. It informs the actions of the characters as well, which is good.3. The characters were believable.4. The situations were believable (lots of politics here; people behaving badly).Things I didn\'t like:1. So loooong! And I read fast, I mean really fast. I\'m not bragging here, just saying that a long book is not in the least intimidating to me; in fact I welcome these, because they keep my brain occupied. It is super dense, though, and took me forever just to get through a few chapters.2. Depressing, dark, sad. My take on the central theme: life sucks, then you die. Or you are wrongly accused of crimes, or you have to run away, or you lose everything you love. I realize life is not happy all the time...but never? If I want to be brought down 100% of the time, I\'ll read nonfiction.3. Too many people in too many places all at the same time, and with too many points of view. Using the analogy of a chess game, it makes me think of a 3D chess game, in which the different dimensions are additional boards jammed into one.Hope this is helpful.
