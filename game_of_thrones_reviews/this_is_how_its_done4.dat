This is a meticulous epic of nobles, knights, kings, and traitors set to a very subtle fantasy backdrop, which pulls you in deeper with every page.  A Game of Thrones is quite easily the best single fantasy novel I\'ve ever read- and there have been many.  So it stands to reason that you just might  enjoy it yourself!I\'ve never seen an author so consistently brilliant  as Martin has been in these 835 pages. This is no fluke. After just this  one book, I am positive that he is one of the top three talents in the  Fantasy genre.  Tolkien... Jordan...  Hobbs... Watch out for George R. R.  Martin- He has his eyes on the throne!-There are some who feel this  story has too many main characters. That it is too confusing. Any veteran  of Jordan will take to GoT like a duck to water. In fact, pick out your  favorite Wheel of Time book... This destroys it.-Want more? Heard of  that short story collection called "Legends" featuring all the modern  masters of fantasy? Do NOT miss Martin\'s "The Hedge Knight" -It\'s Dynamite!
