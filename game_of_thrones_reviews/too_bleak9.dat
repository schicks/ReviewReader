After hearing so much about this I tried again to get into it (having failed to finish the book 10 years ago or so) but still couldn\'t. I can understand why some people like the grittiness aspect, but I\'m not personally interested in reading about an actual medieval world. By actual I mean that almost everyone is miserable, kind of like a Hobbessian worldview of life being nasty, brutish, and short. I prefer fantasy worlds that are different and a bit more enlightened, or at the very least ones where some of the characters are likeable. I found very few of the POV characters in this book endearing at all, and the ones that are get killed. Bleh.The world is also really low magic which I don\'t care for. If you are really into medieval politics and a very "gray" story, however, this is probably more your thing.
