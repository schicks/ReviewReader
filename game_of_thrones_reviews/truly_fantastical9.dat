One day I stumbled upon A GAME OF THRONES while browsing through the library. I am forever grateful. George R.R. Martin has written an epic masterpiece that is intelligent, gripping, and reflective of the very best qualities of fiction (not just fantasy).A GAME OF THRONES is a sweeping tale of the continent of Westeros, a land torn asunder by political intrigues. In King\'s Landing, capitol of the Seven Kingdoms, the mysterious death of the King\'s Hand sets into motion power plays and political games. Eddard Stark, a northern lord as hard as winter, is chosen by King Robert Baratheon as the new King\'s Hand. Stark is drawn into a game for which he has no taste, forced to leave his children and wife, yet duty-bound to discover the causes for the death of his friend Jon Arryn, the old King\'s Hand. But Stark finds that honor has no place in King\'s Landing, where the truth is a matter of deadly danger.A GAME OF THRONES, through the use of multiple perspectives and masterful writing, is a powerful and unforgettable story about the shattered Seven Kingdoms. Pure good and pure evil holds no place in Martin\'s writing. We come to know every person as an individual, each with unique ambitions and dreams. Their reactions are realistic and human. Our ideas of an event are twisted and turned as we see it through the eyes of different characters, each of which have remained in my memory long after I have turned the last page.I highly recommend A GAME OF THRONES, and moreover the entire "A Song of Ice and Fire" series to anyone who is patient and enjoys reading. I promise that if you have these two qualities, you will not be disappointed.
