All of the other excellent reviews of this series are correct.  The writing is wonderful.  The characters are real.  The plot is intricate, fascinating, and never predictable.  Et cetera.  But none of the reviewers complained about the one thing that has led me to stop reading after plugging through the first two books: This is the darkest, bleakest, most depressing book I have ever read!  You must never, ever let yourself bond with a hero, a good, kind, strong, resourceful person who in a \'normal\' book would win a gratifying victory at the end of the book.  This is because chances are your hero will soon die, most likely brutally.  Most (eventually all???) of the good guys die in this book!  And everyone is always having to look over his shoulder to see which one of his supposed friends is plotting his death.  Innocent children are brutally murdered and their heads put up on pikes.  Innocent peasants are slowly hanged, kicking, their eyes bulging out.  Their rescuers, instead of pulling off a valiant rescue, are themselves captured and tortured.  There are innumerable rapes, including several fairly explicit portrayals of vicious gang rapes of peasant women by invading troops.  Every time I finished a reading session I felt depressed.  I\'ve never seen so much plague, betrayal, death, and destruction in a novel.  It\'s unrelenting.  I don\'t care how wonderful the writing is.  I simply couldn\'t take it anymore.  I want to be uplifted by a book, made to smile and feel vicariously triumphant.  I don\'t want to be beaten down and defeated over and over and over.  I had to stop reading.
