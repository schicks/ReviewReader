I picked up A Game of Thrones after I saw a post on the internet, made by a fellow fan of Terry Goodkind, that described how that reader thought Martin\'s work was more brutal than Goodkind\'s.  So I figured I had to see that to believe it.  And what began as a quest for violent fantasy turned into a discovery of a fantastic series.By the time I was halfway through A Game of Thrones I already knew that I would want to read every volume in the series and went out and purchased the next two.  I finished the first volume last night and went right into the second.  It is definitely a gripping saga.  I\'ve been recommending the series to my friends and a few of them are still acting skeptical but I think they are just afraid to admit that I was right.  Heh.The deceptions and the conspiracies within the flowing plotline keep the readers locked in for long, page-turning nights.  It eventually got to the point for me that I HAD to know the outcome of the situations that arose.  I wanted to see some of the more sinister characters get what they truly deserved.I am a huge fan of Frank Herbert\'s Dune and the complex worlds and houses within, the Duniverse as some fans refer to it.  So the political intrigue in Martin\'s novels was an aspect that caught my attention right off.  As a personal preference of mine, the more characters there are, the better.So if you enjoy "mature fantasy" and a complex plotline that encompasses a large number of characters, then I highly recommend George R. R. Martin\'s "A Song of Ice and Fire" saga.
