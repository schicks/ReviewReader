Scott Fitzgerald, a monumental talent who only occasionally got things working right, made Gatsby great by the extraordinary invention of Nick Carraway.  Carraway as narrator provided the exact perfect pitch:  more awestruck than he would admit, more moral than it was fashionable to reveal -- always objective and distanced and subtle and charming, genuinely decent and impeccably well mannered, a little dangerously smitten himself by the lovely but corrupt Jordan Baker.Alexander Scourby, one of the greatest reading voices of his era (overlapping Fitzgerald\'s enough to know and feel it all) here does Carraway in a way that cannot, therefore, again be quite equalled.  Imagine having a recording of a great contemporary actor reading Ahab\'s speeches in Moby Dick, and one begins to appreciate the gift that we only now have in recorded sound, something we are already quite casual about.  But there is much more here than historical accuracy.  Scourby\'s voice wraps around every phrase of Fitzgeral\'s text with both an actor\'s professionalism and a good reader\'s care, making it not only uncannily his own monument but also a monument in audio book history.  It sets the bar, and anyone interested in the recorded voice as an art form should own this for repeated learning.
