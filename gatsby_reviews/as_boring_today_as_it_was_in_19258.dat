The Great Gatsby is a very great and meaningful novel about how empty our lives can be and blah blah blah.  A lot of people who are a lot smarter than I am say a lot of great things about The Great Gatsby.  Sarah Churchwell, a professor of American Literature in the UK calls it a "cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream."  She goes on to discuss social politics and the betrayal of one\'s own ideals.  Journalist Nick Gillespie says the story is about "the breakdown of class differences in the face of a modern economy based not on status and inherited position but on innovation and an ability to meet ever-changing consumer needs.  Quite a mouthful, that.Those people make The Great Gatsby sound pretty important, but to the common working man like myself, this is a boring audiobook about absolutely nothing.  If I had to assign any meaning to it, I would have to say that it\'s about what meaningless lives the idle rich lead, how they throw money around like candy at a parade while millions starve, and how they can get away with things the rest of us can\'t, even murder.  I won\'t go so far as to say that I\'m sorry I read The Great Gatsby; even if you don\'t like an audiobook it can still make you think, and therefore expand your world view.  Books have that kind of power, even mediocre ones.  Oh, and during its original sale run in 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold fewer than 20,000 copies to the great disappointment of F Scott Fitzgerald and his publishers.The main reason I picked up this copy of The Great Gatsby at the library, was because it was narrated by Frank Muller, one of my all-time favorite narrators.  This guy was simply an amazing reader of books and I learned some time ago that anything he reads is worth listening to.  As boring as this book is, I actually finished the whole thing, which is a tribute to what a great narrator Frank Muller was.  Muller was one of the pioneers of the field, going to work for Recorded Books way back in 1979.  In 2001 he was involved in a motorcycle crash and suffered severe head trauma, eventually leading to his death in 2008.Okay, I was a little harsh.  Obviously, a lot of people really like The Great Gatsby.  I am not one of them, mainly because I just don\'t get novels that use a lot of symbolism and have hidden meanings and such.  Don\'t knock it \'til you try it, that\'s what I always say.
