A dreadful version of the timeless classic, this ill-considered reading by Robbins dulls the novel\'s sharp social criticism. Robbins is best suited to comedy, to loveable boobs who stumble through life without a hint of tragedy or despair. These human conditions weigh heavily inside the black heart of Fitgerald\'s work, which is unsettling not only for its accurate portrayal of patrician soullessness but also for its message that the American Dream is a rotten carrot dangled before us. Robbins is the wrong voice for the job. As other reviewers have noted, his female characters come off like opium addled Mississippians. This Louisvillian can attest that our women, here represented by Daisy and Jordan, do not talk like deep fried lotus eaters. How disappointing to get yet another unsatisfactory rendering of Fitzgerald, arguably our best writer, if not the best chronicler of the class stratification that we Americans try so desperately to deny. The film with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford remains an umwatchable dud, but this reading is equally poor.
