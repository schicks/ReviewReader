The wonder of F. Scott FitzGerald\'s magnum opus is that he has created a great mirror for any individual looking into it. Therefore, a god can see a god and a fool can see a fool. Reading the various reviews from a wide  variety of supposed learned individuals, I must say that this masterpiece  is not just a well written story or even art, but a great mirror that can  reflect whatever an individual may have to offer to oneself. Within each of  us, live all the characters that appear in this novel (if we\'re lucky) from  Jay Gatsby to George Wilson. Obviously, some readers (amazon reviewers  included) have lost key characters far too early in their life. The style  and language of the story is both engaging and active. It stimulates the  mind of the reader to create and not just follow, as most common writers  will have us do. In a world of sheep that think themselves as wolves, this  work may seem less than satisfying. Being given the opportunity to look  into a mirror and truly look at ourselves verses shown an idealistic  picture and told that that image is we, many will chose the latter. History  has shown that most people prefer the illusions of life. As J.D Salinger  simply put it "They\'re all a bunch of phonies..."
