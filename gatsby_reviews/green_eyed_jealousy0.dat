This is a marvelous look into the green-eyed monster of sexual jealousy. It\'s ripe with symbolic imagery from Fitzgerald\'s personal agony over his wife adulterous affair.Everyone knows the superficial lit class interpretation of the novel; idealistic Gatsby pursues fortune in vain attempt to dazzle and win golden girl, only to have her reject him. Conclusion: classic condemnation of the hollowness of upper class materialism. Rubbish!The story is not political. It is personal pure and simple! It would have taken place anytime, any place those two particular personalities came together. In real life Fitzgerald won his Zelda. But he then promptly and insouciantly cheated on her. She got him back by cheating on him. In his journals Fitzgerald wrote that something died at this time. Shortly afterward the couple moved to Paris.Does this not parallel George Wilson\'s reaction to his wife\'s affair in The Great Gatsby?  Yes, Wilson is also Fitzgerald, the tortured, jealous part of Fitzgerald who mourns the loss of his wife even as he realizes her for what she is.  Myrtle is the low class floozy that Zelda has become in Fitzgerald\'s eyes by cuckolding him.Wilson tries to hold on to his wife by locking her up until he can transact a business deal (buying the coupe) and thereby have the money to take her "west", something they had long talked about but which he is now going to make her do.Analogously, Fitzgerald sold short stories (seeing himself as stooping to low class laborer by writing for commerce instead of art\'s sake?)to pay his and Zelda\'s way to Paris, removing her from her paramour\'s proximity.Who actually kills Gatsby? The symbol of idealism and optimism (Gatsby)is killed by the symbol of grief and jealousy (Wilson). Fitzgerald was disillusioned by Zelda\'s adultery not class materialism.Who does that leave Daisy/Zelda with in the end? Tom, the lout, the woman beater, the snob.  Realizing, to his relief, that Daisy will never actually leave him, Tom becomes smug. Go ahead, he tells Gatsby (or any man who now idolizes Zelda), flirt with her all you want. She\'ll always come crawling back to me! If Gatsby is how Fitzgerald wants to be, Tom is the husband Fitzgerald actually is.Daisy, Myrtle and Jordan are all Zelda; Daisy the debutante on a pedestal, Myrtle the common floozy, Jordan the sophisticate pursuing her own identity and career. But Jordan has no address of her own. She lives off other people and cheats on her golf game, just as Fitzgerald claimed that Zelda stole from him material for her own writing career.This is the world as seen through the eyes of a self-centered, tyrannical egoist, but with one saving grace, Nick the observer, the recorder. Nick is the writer in Fitzgerald, and for all his faults as a man, Fitzgerald was one heck-of-a-writer.
