41The first time I encountered Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it was as an assignment in a high school Proper_Noun class. My recent re-read occurred after my son had read it in his high school Proper_Noun class. The reread brought back memories of a form of academic study from which I have been separated for many years."The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is an excellent book in which to study the writer\'s art. In this short book the reader can detect a collection of symbolic details which make the story much more than the tale which appears on the surface: the ash heap, as a symbol of the waste of American society; the green light on Proper_Noun dock, which means so much to Proper_Noun as a symbol, until he again meets Proper_Noun when it again becomes, for Proper_Noun as for everyone else, just a light.The characters all play their roles in the development of the story. Shallow figures fill Proper_Noun parties, but show their true level of concern for him when they all absent themselves from his funeral. The class distinctions between Proper_Noun a true upper class maiden, who can never lower herself to accept Proper_Noun the aspirant to a class rank which wealth and parties cannot buy. Proper_Noun source of wealth is hinted at by his association with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the gambler who fixed the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Like others, he will associate with Proper_Noun in life, but has no time for him in death.The unnatural core of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is illustrated by his act of moving east, rather than the traditional westward migration, in order to achieve freedom and advancement.Tom and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun represent old money, which will not accept Proper_Noun and, in the end, destroys him.Nick Carraway is the one character in the book who develops his own moral sense. His role as narrator permits us to see Proper_Noun Proper_Noun through his eyes. It is he who sees, and is repelled by, the rotten cores of Proper_Noun and the worlds in which lives and into which he aspires. He sees the corruption deep inside Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Most of all, we see the innate goodness in Proper_Noun Observing, but not entering Proper_Noun world, he is able to understand and judge it. His final evaluation of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is seen when he abandons it all to return to his native Proper_Noun I re-read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I remembered what I had not liked about it the first time I read it. The causal acceptance of infidelity seems at odds with what I have always viewed as the ideal as well as the reality. As one studies the commentaries of this book, with all of its symbolisms, I often wonder if the symbols were really in Proper_Noun Scott Proper_Noun mind as he wrote the book, or whether they are constructs of later commentators. Either way, they give the book a depth which so many others lack. When my son speaks of other books he reads in Proper_Noun class, he always says "It\'s no Proper_Noun Gatsby." The more I think of it, few of novels are.
