A lot of people who are a lot smarter than I am say a lot of Proper_Noun things about The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Sarah Proper_Noun a professor of American Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun calls it a "cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream." She goes on to discuss social politics and the betrayal of one\'s own ideals.

Quite a mouthful, that.Those people make The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun sound pretty important, but to the common working man like myself, this is a boring audiobook about absolutely nothing. If I had to assign any meaning to it, I would have to say that it\'s about what meaningless lives the idle rich lead, how they throw money around like candy at a parade while millions starve, and how they can get away with things the rest of us can\'t, even murder. I won\'t go so far as to say that Proper_Noun sorry I read The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun even if you don\'t like an audiobook it can still make you think, and therefore expand your world view. Proper_Noun have that kind of power, even mediocre ones.

Obviously, a lot of people really like The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I am not one of them, mainly because I just don\'t get novels that use a lot of symbolism and have hidden meanings and such. Don\'t knock it \'til you try it, that\'s what I always say.
