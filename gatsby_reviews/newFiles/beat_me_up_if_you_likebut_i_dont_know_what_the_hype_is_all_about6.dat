4Review: I know Proper_Noun get beaten up for saying this Proper_Noun honestly, I do not understand what the hype about this book is all about. I understand it is reflective of 1920s Proper_Noun and there are lines of brilliance Proper_Noun personally like Proper_Noun quote about how she wishes her daughter to grow up to be a beautiful little fool) Proper_Noun I found nothing special about this tale. I\'m sure it managed to express the superficiality and cultural emptiness that many could not articulate when it was first published. The main character, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems like a doormat character with a narration that is so vague and passive that I couldn\'t take him seriously. I realize, however, that his character complements the time frame and works well with the other characters (especially Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was excited about reading this book because it\'s considered a classic, and all I had heard of were rave reviews. Less than halfway through this book I had already grown frustrated at it, and when I searched online for some "negative" reviews on it I only found a handful (though they were all written with a bit of an irritant tone, understandably).Why didn\'t I like The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Because I feel was too watered down, in more ways than one. Many rave about the eloquence and figurative language of the book, and Proper_Noun slightly agree to that Proper_Noun I still didn\'t find anything that completely stuck me as pure brilliance.Now I\'m a sucker for good symbolism, so I was naturally disappointed with this book in that sense as well \u2014 yes, there is the green light, the eyes of Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I wasn\'t convinced. The eyes of Proper_Noun symbolize Proper_Noun and how he is always watching over you, and the green light is up for interpretations. I suppose the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun was the best one out of the three, Proper_Noun still.This may sound rather far fetched, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun reminds me of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the sense that he isn\'t really a character per se; he merely represents a notion (though they represent two completely different ideas, that is certain). Proper_Noun say out of all the characters I liked Proper_Noun the most, just because she represented a lot of the cultural scenes of 1920s. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was the typical hot-headed, intelligently stupid kind of guy. And as for the ending...the best way I can sum up my reaction is "oh" (though delving into it you could come up with a string of meanings).Wrap up: I find this to be the typical high school read \u2014 a bit of symbolism here, the typical passive narrator there, and a handful of cardboard cut characters with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun being the "illusion" of the American dream. I wasted my time reading this book, I really did. I haven\'t seen the 2013 film adaption of it, only the second-most popular one by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and I think it captured the awkwardness and pure nullity that I saw in this book. The best way to express my disappointment is with this: If I had my own copy of this text, it wouldn\'t have space on my bookshelf even as a classic.
