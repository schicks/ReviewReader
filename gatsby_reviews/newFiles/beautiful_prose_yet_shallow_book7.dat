9I found it practically impossible to enjoy this book because it is about shallow, careless and carefree people. Because the characters are extremely dull and flippant about life, I found the book itself to be a dull read. It was like trying to swallow terrible tasting medicine. This book certainly does not attempt to tackle any of life\'s problems. I give this book two stars rather than one, however, because Proper_Noun deserves credit for the mystical, beautifully flowing,light, prose which he uses. I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the chapter of the garden party at Proper_Noun mansion, as well as the end of the novel.
