37I read it after the new movie was announced, decent book well written in simple english..nothing fancy at all. The writer does not create a 500 page monster by describing the hem line on dresses and instead keeps it short and sweet and at the same time gives you a visual idea of the scene. A simple story about rise and fall of Proper_Noun narrated by a another character.
