1This time I had to read it for a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun class and liked it no better than when I had to read it in college.A story of the meaningless lives led by people of old money and new money, their predudicies against each other and much else in the post Proper_Noun era.It is all incomprehensible to me and I don\'t care enough about it to want to have wasted time reading it again.
