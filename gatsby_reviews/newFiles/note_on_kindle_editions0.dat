212There are two Proper_Noun editions of The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun both at the same price.Unfortunately the Proper_Noun I bought, from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has a number of minor transcription errors. The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence. There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are several Proper_Noun editions available, you might want to avoid the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun one with the car on the cover) and try the\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Scribner-Edition/dp/B000FC0PDA">Scribner Proper_Noun one with the dark blue cover with a face superimposed).
