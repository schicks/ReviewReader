10To me this is literary perfection. It is Proper_Noun only book I know of that is complete: not a word should be cut, or added. It has a palpable mood in which Proper_Noun reader in engulfed: decadence, melancholy, longing, hope, failures, dreams, and an unflinching striving for something purer in a world that wants to drag us into its arrogant and indifferent corruption. Gatsby is Proper_Noun romantic hero, and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun sensitive observer on whom Proper_Noun moral foundation of Proper_Noun book rests. The symbolism is simple and works unobtrusively. I love this book and have read it several times now. It is like a great painting or scene that holds in its smallest details Proper_Noun universal design or chaos if that be Proper_Noun paradox.Reading some of Proper_Noun reviews I find people\'s opinions varying greatly. Some very intelligent people dislike it, even hate it while others love it, or think it good. The same can be said of not so intelligent people. As Proper_Noun puts it: "I was within and witout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by Proper_Noun inexaustible variety of life."Do not be too greatly influenced by reviews or Proper_Noun book\'s reputation, simply read it and decide for yourself. In Proper_Noun end considering how short Proper_Noun novel is, how accessible, and if nothing else(I personally think it is much more) a literary phenomenom, it is worth reading for anyone interested in novels and literature
