23The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Scott Proper_Noun is one of my all time favorite novels. I have read it a few times and decided I would like to have an audio copy for my car. I should have heeded the advice of another reviewer who complained of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun reading of the characters.First of all, he gave every single woman character a dimwitted Southern accent while most of the men had a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun accent.While I admit the characters were written as somewhat vain and shallow, they were not intended to sound perpetually drunk and/or stupid. He did a fine job as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the narrator, but to hear this guy do Proper_Noun is a disappointment to say the least. To hear Proper_Noun Proper_Noun tell it, Proper_Noun sounds like each breath is to be his last as if he is suffering the onset of a stroke or some such unpleasantness. Also, he is a little sloppy when switching from dialogue to regular prose.I still enjoyed the CD because the story is so phenomenal, but a different reader would have made it much better.On another note however, the sixth and final CD contains the readings of some of Proper_Noun letters to publishers and others writers etc... The reader is someone else Proper_Noun I forget the name) and he does a nice job of the readings. One feels as though they are listening to the real Proper_Noun For diehard fans, this little extra makes the whole thing worth the $19.I hate to rip on Proper_Noun as I find him to be an excellent and versatile actor, this however, is simply not his cup of tea.
