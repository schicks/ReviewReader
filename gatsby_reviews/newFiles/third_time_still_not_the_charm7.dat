5I\'m an avid reader of both popular and literary fiction and on my third reading still could not find much of value in "Gatsby." The claim that "Gatsby" is the "great American novel" or the greatest novel of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or of the 20th century has been repeated so often it\'s become Proper_Noun mindless mantra. I have been persistent in searching for its value. I first read it in high school, reread it in my thirties and just reread it again in my 50s. Each time I found it to be mostly Proper_Noun waste of time with the exception of some of Proper_Noun pithy descriptions of character. There\'s no question that his descriptive writing can be sharp and evocative but to what end? All but one of the characters in "Gatsby" are air-headed, self-absorbed, manipulative snobs with whom - try as I have - I feel no shred of empathy. The dialogue is banal, the plot twists amount to cheesy melodrama, and the women characters are especially vapid. If the point of the book is that people with misplaced values are delusional and damaging to themselves and others, Proper_Noun If the book indeed captures Proper_Noun small segment of the lives of the indolent wealthy in the 1920s, Proper_Noun But the great American novel? For that, I need something with considerably more depth and, generally, Proper_Noun more epic canvas.\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Moby-Dick/dp/1470178192">Moby Proper_Noun class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Grapes-of-Wrath/dp/0143039431">The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun class="a-link-normal" href="/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird/dp/0446310786">To Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun class="a-link-normal" href="/Ragtime-A-Novel/dp/0812978188">Ragtime: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun just Proper_Noun few that come to mind. One virtue of "Gatsby" is that it is short, just 180 pages. You might want to read it to see what the fuss is about. I won\'t be going back to it for Proper_Noun fourth time, that\'s for sure. I give it two stars for some good descriptive prose; nothing else in the book works for me.
