2This is the second time Proper_Noun read this book and it\'s gone up a full two stars in my estimation. It\'s about ten years since my first reading and I can\'t remember why I didn\'t like it back then, but it may have had something to do with the fact that it\'s quite a depressing story.Now I appreciate the subtleties of it a bit more and I can see that it\'s an attack on the concept of the Proper_Noun dream which Proper_Noun Proper_Noun buys into hook, line and sinker. My interpretation was helped by a review I read of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun film. Sadly it seems Proper_Noun has been as seduced by the glitz and glamour as Proper_Noun himself and missed the whole point of the story, but I digress.Daisy represents the world of wealth and privilege Proper_Noun desperately wants to be part of, and he thinks that if he can possess her then he will have fulfilled his heart\'s desire Proper_Noun reminds me a lot of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun in this sense). Never mind that Proper_Noun is shallow, frivolous and spoilt, because it\'s not really the woman he loves, and he makes this clear when he tells Proper_Noun her voice sounds like money. She is the first truly wealthy person he has come in close contact with and her money casts a spell over him that leads to his undoing.Gatsby sells his soul to make enough money to win Proper_Noun over and the extent of his corruption and naivet\xe9 is tragically clear at the end when none of the people who were so happy to partake of his hospitality can be bothered attending his funeral. Proper_Noun doesn\'t even call or send flowers. Proper_Noun is just collateral damage to them, a victim of the selfish, ruthless world he yearned to be a part of.The writing in the book is deceptively simple because it\'s poetic and even enchanting at times in its descriptions. He captures the essence of the jazz era so well that I felt like I was at the boozy parties, breathing the smoky air and watching everyone get drunker and more debauched. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it\'s made me want to go back and re-read some of the books Proper_Noun dismissed in the past because your perspective can change dramatically over time.
