I suspect that there are three types of readers.1) People who read just to read a good story2) People who read for the beauty of the prose and the beauty of the way the story is told3) People who are a combination of bothI myself am #1. I like to read an interesting story that keeps thrilled and entertained. I am trying to also become more like #2, but I haven\'t got there yet. The story in the book was mildly interesting. That is why I gave the book three stars. It was easy to follow, but still only mildly interesting. I guess as I study literature more, I will come back and reread this book.
