There are two Kindle editions of The Great Gatsby, both at the same price.Unfortunately the edition I bought, from Old Landmark Publishing, has a number of minor transcription errors.  The most notable is the occasionalinsertion of multiple paragraphbreaks within a sentence.  There are also occasional misplaced paragraph breaks in dialog paragraphs, which sometimes leads to confusion about which character is speaking.I downloaded the free sample of the Scribner Edition and although that is only a short sample, it appears to be a much better quality transcription.So since there are several Kindle editions available, you might want to avoid the Old Landmark Publishing Edition (the one with the car on the cover) and try the\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Scribner-Edition/dp/B000FC0PDA">Scribner Edition</a>\xa0(the one with the dark blue cover with a face superimposed).
