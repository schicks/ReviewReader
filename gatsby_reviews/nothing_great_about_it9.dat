I like to think of myself as an open-minded person, willing to embrace any good story that comes into my life, as long as there is some meaning behind it.  Hell, there doesn\'t even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all.  The Great Gatsby has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think.  Of course, that is only my opinion and I can\'t tell others what to think.When I began reading The Great Gatsby, my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read).  I knew that it was considered a masterpiece.  I saw that it was number two on the Modern Library\'s 100 greatest novels.  Yet, I didn\'t roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.The Great Gatsby is told from the point of view of Nick Callaway, a middle class man who moves back East into a wealthy neighborhood.  The book opens with him at his cousin\'s house.  A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters.  We meet Tom, an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man.  We meet Daisy, Tom\'s wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl.  Finally, we meet Jordan.  Jordan is Daisy\'s good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman.  They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.In the scenes that follow we encounter Jay Gatsby, who is supposedly the hero of the story.  He is the American Dream.  He is the typical "rags to riches" story some of us might envy.  He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him.  Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from.  He throws large parties and invites Nick to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Gatsby has no interest in.The reason Gatsby engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Daisy, (Tom\'s wife).  He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Tom.  Tom, meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel.  I won\'t reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Tom, Daisy, Tom\'s mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress\'s husband, Mr. Wilson.  If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you.  Although by that time, if you are like me, you won\'t really care.  The narrator, Nick, meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.The Great Gatsby fails on so many levels.  I don\'t know where to start.  The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic.  I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different.  I read the Cliff Notes and it still did not change my opinion.  What good are symbols when their meaning doesn\'t really add to the depth or meaning of the story?Another major failure is the dismal writing style.  I couldn\'t stand it.  To me, it seemed Fitzgerald just wanted to show off his vocabulary.  I don\'t have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story.  Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional.  I didn\'t feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending.  I have said this in other reviews I have written.  How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don\'t even care about?  It is impossible.  I really didn\'t care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces.  Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was.  Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.The Great Gatsby has been said to mean things varying from "Social Stratification" to "Religion", to the seven deadly sins, and so on.  Rest assured that I don\'t rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great.  I did not hate this book, but as a "classic", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read.  In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times.  If I had to some up The Great Gatsby in one word, it would be "empty."  If I could have one more word it would be "hollow."  You be the judge.  The only thing more mysterious than Jay Gatsby, and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered great by anyone.Grade: C-
