The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is one of my all time favorite novels. I have read it a few times and decided I would like to have an audio copy for my car. I should have heeded the advice of another reviewer who complained of Tim Robbins\' reading of the characters.First of all, he gave every single woman character a dimwitted Southern accent while most of the men had a New York accent.While I admit the characters were written as somewhat vain and shallow,  they were not intended to sound perpetually drunk and/or stupid. He did a fine job as Nick Carraway, the narrator, but to hear this guy do Gatsby is a disappointment to say the least. To hear Tim Robbins tell it, Gatsby sounds like each breath is to be his last as if he is suffering the onset of a stroke or some such unpleasantness. Also, he is a little sloppy when switching from dialogue to regular prose.I still enjoyed the CD because the story is so phenomenal, but a different reader would have made it much better.On another note however, the sixth and final CD contains the readings of some of F.Scott\'s letters to publishers and others writers etc... The reader is someone else (sorry, I forget the name) and he does a nice job of the readings. One feels as though they are listening to the real Fitzgerald. For diehard fans, this little extra makes the whole thing worth the $19.I hate to rip on Robbins as I find him to be an excellent and versatile actor, this however, is simply not his cup of tea.
