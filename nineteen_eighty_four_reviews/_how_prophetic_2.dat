This is one of those classics that I never got around to reading while in high school (it was required, but I just didn\'t read it ;)... At the request of a colleague I picked this book up last year and was blown away by point of the book.  In the chaotic and unclear times we live in, I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to understand what the point of the elite is and what the point of government is.  Everything is about control and power ... AND KEEPING IT.  We live in the novel 1984 ... and that\'s scary.  Should be required reading for all Americans.
