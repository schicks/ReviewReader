One of my favorite classics that I, even though it is very depressing, recommend anyone interested in reading to read this book.Set in a nightmarish London of 1984 \u2013 we see life in a totalitarian state through the eyes of a single character, Winston Smith, who dares to standup against the notorious \u2013 notorious in our world \u2013 Big Brother in his own ways, through little defiant acts, such as keeping a journal stating his disapproval with his world and the government, to sneaking off and having sex with a woman for pleasure which is looked down upon as sex is only seen as a necessary for procreation.In this world, Freedom was only attained through total obedience to the Party, and the love of Big Brother, who watched you at all times.  Winston works as a functionary of the Ministry of Truth where history is rewritten to favor the Party\u2019s line summed up beautifully by the Party\u2019s slogan "Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."  A little at a time Winston begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed.  This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Socialism to Communism to Totalitarianism.With today\u2019s technology, Big Brother is a real threat and with the Government growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future \u2013 if we are not careful.
