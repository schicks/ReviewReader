"Big Brother is watching!" This phrase has been so popularly used that the meaning is now synonymous with issues like "manipulation of truth", "violation of privacy", "conspiracy theory", etc. `1984\' is a cleverly written political satire often induced with dark humour, exploring life in a would-be fascist-like totalitarian future where everyone was being monitored and compelled to keep in line (\'thoughtcrime\' is a crime!), where the individual could no longer differentiate between truths and lies (through the practice of `doublethink\'), where history was being constantly re-written to suit the prevailing political agenda, where language had been simplified to the point of uselessness (through Newspeak), where war had to be kept ongoing to reduce economic surplus so that the population could be held under control, and where party ideology had absolute power over a society dominated by fear, suspicion and distrust.We follow the story of Winston Smith, one who disagreed with the party and was secretly envisioning a different kind of life without being under the ever-watchful eye of Big Brother. His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell\'s gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell\'s vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell\'s `1984\' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended.
