1984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of English literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously  thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and  horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is  factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the  people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist  Winston Smith\'s resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the  Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the  debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian  government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies,  cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long  past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future  may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is  brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a  definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars.
