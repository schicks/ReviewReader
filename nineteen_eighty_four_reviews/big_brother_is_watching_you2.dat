_Nineteen Eighty Four_, first published in 1949 by George Orwell (pen name of Eric Blair), is a horrifying dystopian novel of a world in which the individual human being has been completely degraded and deprived of his fundamental humanity that reflects the totalitarianisms of the day, particularly communism and Stalinism.  George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power.  Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists.  As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels showing the degrading effects such societies had on people.  Throughout this book, one can witness the underlying hatred of Orwell and those imprisoned by the system for the totalitarian state and bureaucracy which completely controls their lives and existences.  This book in particular shows that rage in the main character of Winston Smith, a mere pawn in a totalitarian society.  Orwell\'s books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power.  Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men, and maintaining a total disregard for the truth.  Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda.  This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell\'s stories.  However, Orwell\'s books are also applicable to the West of today, where the constant menace of totalitarian ideology exists._1984_ gives us a whole slew of new terminology to describe the situation as it exists in a totalitarian state in which political correctness is enforced.  The book introduces such terms as thought police, thought crime (and thought criminal), doublethink, memory hole, Ingsoc, and Newspeak.  Such terms reflect the complete disregard of the totalitarian state for the truth and the active promotion of propaganda within society.  They have also largely entered into our culture as expressions to describe the enforcement of political correctness._1984_ focuses on the main character Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who lives in England and works for the Ministry of Truth.  As it turns out, the Ministry of Truth ironically is responsible for spreading propaganda, and as all ministries mentioned by Orwell has a purpose exactly opposite to its stated purpose.  The world of 1984 is a very bleak one indeed, run by a single party and its ruling leader "Big Brother", in which all individuals are subject to surveillance by the state should they commit a "thought crime".  All expressions of individuality in 1984 have been wiped out and the human being is totally degraded living a pathetic existence of total subservience to the party.  Sexuality has been suppressed as part of the "Anti-sex League" as well as religion.  Truth itself is highly malleable and memory is constantly distorted, reflected in such ironical and oxymoronic sayings of the party as "War Is Peace", "Freedom Is Slavery", and "Ignorance Is Strength".  Further, the nation of Oceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, varying from day to day and reflected in the official propaganda of the state bureaucracy.  All party members revere their leader "Big Brother" (perhaps reminiscent of Josef Stalin or other totalitarian dictators) and despise  the rebellious "Goldstein" (perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet hatred for Leon Trotsky).  Further, the party exists in a caste system in which the "proles" (the proletariat) live underneath the party members (who are divided into the Inner and Outer Party).  Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth but begins to keep a diary (which is strictly forbidden to party members) in which he reflects his hatred for "Big Brother".  His work involves developing propaganda for the party.  At work he meets up with Julia, who he initially believes is a strict orthodox member of the party.  However, eventually he comes to realize that Julia is in love with him and they have a secret encounter in the countryside.  Eventually Julia expresses to Winston her complete loathing for the party, though she publicly maintains a persona of utter obeisance and orthodoxy and belongs to the "Anti-sex League".  Together they find a new hiding place in a shop in a part of the city where the "proles" live and attempt to re-discover the past of England.  Throughout this period, however, the two live in constant fear of the thought police, should they catch onto their affair.  Eventually, Winston meets up with O\'Brien at work, a man who he believes is a member of the Resistance, and is given a copy of Goldstein\'s book which explains the rise of the party and the need for perpetual war.  Orwell quotes extensively from Goldstein\'s book which reflects much of the social thinking of the time, in particular the theory of managerial elites.  However, Winston and Julia are captured by the party and it turns out that O\'Brien is in fact a member of the party.  While taken captive, both are tortured and made to recant their original beliefs about the party.  In a particularly disgusting scene, Winston is taken to Room 101 where he must face his worst fear.  There he ultimately betrays Julia (as she has already betrayed him) to save himself from being tortured by rats (the worst torture that he can imagine).  Eventually, Winston is completely re-educated and made to love "Big Brother" while his relationship with Julia is forever changed after their mutual betrayals of each other.  Thus, ends in the most horrifying of manners Orwell\'s classic novel.  Orwell concludes with an appendix on "The Principles of Newspeak" which effectively shows how even the language itself can be put to the purposes of propaganda within a totalitarian state._1984_ remains a classic dystopia reflecting the darker side of human existence within the Twentieth Century as it played out in the totalitarian dictatorships of the age.  Throughout this novel, the very notion of truth remains problematic, as the party re-defines history to reflect its own agenda and thus even memory itself becomes distorted.  Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most.  While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity.  Orwell\'s novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism.  As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies.
