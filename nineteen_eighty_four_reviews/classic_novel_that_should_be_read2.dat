George Orwell\'s "1984" is one of those classics from the late 1940s that many may have vaguely heard of but not familiar with. Many may not be aware of  the origin of some common phases from the book that are widely used, e.g. "double-think", "big brother", "newspeak".  Not sure that it\'s still part of  most high school education curricula (where I read it in the late 1960s). I bought a copy (along with Orwell\'s "Animal Farm") for one of my post-college daughters who attended what is consider a superior high school, but she has not read either of them then. See my May 2014 review of "Animal Farm" on its Amazon page. (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G6I5FLIJ4UKC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)The relatively short novel should be read by all as part of one\'s education, and if not in entirety, the appendix section give a few pages explanation of "Newspeak" language that should resonate with the use of similar on occasion by present day governments (including our own), corporations, etc. Newspeak can use words and phraseology that actually mean the opposite of  their traditional meanings. This book (along with "Animal Farm") is definitely worth a few hours of reading.The story is about one man\'s life in a totalitarian British society that\'s a thinly disguised copy (but on steriods) of Stalin\'s Soviet Union. Many of societal features described will be familiar to anyone who\'d read objective first-hand accounts, or lived in places like the old Soviet Union, Mao\'s China, North Korea, and some other present day non-democratic countries. Some of the described governmental capabilities and controls are frighteningly modern-day as our present technology allows governments to more easily deployed systems like wide-spread video monitoring, communications monitoring, media/information control, etc.As I got older, the novel is a part my education that gives more appreciation of the wisdom of our country\'s founders in the way they wrote the Constitution, because they did not trust governments (really any people in power) in general to always have the public interests in mind. They set up the  US government to be split into 3 different independent parts to provide some checks against each other, there\'s a Bill of Rights that lists some fundamental things regarding what the government can and can not do, and the Constitution is, on a basic level, a limited list of enumerated federal powers, with all other powers (stated or unstated) reserved to the states and/or the people. Even having all that, we always need to be on guard for potential degradation of what the Constitution intends, e.g. enabling free politcal speech at any time, protection against unreasonable searches, protection against arbitrary government actions (legal right to contest actions before implementation), etc.
