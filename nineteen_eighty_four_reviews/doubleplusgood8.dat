George Orwell\'s 1984 is unquestionably one of my favorite novels, if not my favorite (and not merely because the title is my birth year). Powerful and enlightening, it offers the reader a glimpse into a society in which  the omnipotent State controls the populace through manipulation of  language, alteration of the past, and other devices. With a population  composed of brainwashed Party members and apathetic proles, the zeitgeist  is characterized by contented and unthinking servitude to Big Brother. Yet  Winston Smith (committing an odious, illicit act) begins to think  negatively of the status quo, giving the basis of this thought-provoking  novel. Admittedly, one section (but only one!) becomes a bit tedious,  Goldstein\'s book. Keep reading! The immaculate third chapter soon follows,  culminating in the most effectual ending that I have ever read. Its impact  proves that Orwell successful captivated the reader throughout the novel.  I wonder, considering that literature as chimerical as David Deutsch\'s  Fabric of Reality gains placement as non-fiction, if 1984 has been  incorrectly categorized. It would not surprise me if Pol Pot had used this  novel as a guide book. Of course, elements are also apparent in modern  American society, from the welfare state to political correctness to  surveillance devices. The advice I give to the prospective reader is this:  quit reading reviews (in a worst case scenario one might learn the ending)  and read 1984!~pythia~
