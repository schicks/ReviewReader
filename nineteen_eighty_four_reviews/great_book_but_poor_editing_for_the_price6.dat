If you have not yet read this classic, you absolutely MUST. That is all that can be said about the book itself. Its impact on popular culture alone necessitates a careful perusal.However, after paying almost $9 for this Kindle version (when I\'m fairly confident that a trip to a used bookseller would have uncovered a physical copy for less than $5), I was disappointed to find typographical errors everywhere.I can understand that the publishers are rushing to make their books available electronically, but surely, even Spellcheck would have found some of these errors. Am I the only one bemoaning the lack of craftsmanship in publishing anymore?
