No amount of positive reviewing will do justice to the importance and beauty of this book - you have to read if for yourself.  What I really want to review are the reviews of some reviewers from Wstern countries. They like the book, but their reviews are of the kind \'This is a book about a hypothetical totalitarian dictatorshp, ..., etc.\' What is wrong, is the word \'hypothetical\' This book could have been titled \'Bits of the History of the Communist World (albeit a little allegorical)\'I don\'t know what people born in the West understand in this book. Not much perhaps. The very fact that Orwell is the ONLY Westerner I know of to have written an accurate description (though a bit allegorical) of communism in practice, suggests that most Westerners couldn\'t understand what was happening in the communist world. I suggest that they read it for what it is: History cast into an allegorical novel.Now an example or two. There was a famous picture in history textbooks in communist countries. Lenin in a podium holding a speech, his hand streched to the masses listening. On his left you could see Stalin. Everyone of my age has seen this picture. What most people haven\'t seen, though, is an older version of it: Lenin holding a speech, and on his left, Trotsky. (Winston\'s job right)Now my country (Albania) was great friends with USSR, until 1961, that is. Albania broke up with USSR (considering USSR a traitor of real socialism), to advance real socialism together with China. Not for ever of course - in 1978 China became a traitor of real socialism, too, having in fact never been really socialist.  There was a famous picture in Albanian history textbooks. The Albanian B.B. (Enver Hoxha)  was denouncing the betrayal of real socialism by the Soviet leadership. I have seen all three versions of this painting: In the first one, Enver Hoxha had Chou EnLai on one side and Mehmet Shehu (Albanian Prime Minister) on the other. This was valid between 1961 and 1978. When China betrayed socialism in 1978, Chou Enlai disappeared from the painting, and someone else took his stead. This second version lasted until 1981. That\'s because in 1981 Mehmet Shehu became a traitor, and \'was suicided\'. So he disappeared from the painting, too. This is the last version of it. By the way, the painting stood in the Albanian National Art Gallery. Many people must have seen all three versions of it in original.I could wrie a book longer than 1984, describing how accurate 1984 is.Read 1984 as a history of the communist world; it is valid even for the four decades after Orwell\'s death.Aleksander Coho
