I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report.  I\'ve never been able to forget it.  It\'s the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn\'t forgotten the past, and who wants to  change the future.However, Big Brother is watching him.  Try as he  might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces  extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the  government.Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on  communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold.  I  shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the  slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read.  Let\'s  hope we never come to this.
