I read this book as a teenager but it wasn\'t until I read it again as an adult that I found it deeply disturbing. It is depicts a world often referred to as "orwell\'s nightmare" and has become a cultural touchstone, many of its phrases and terms having become part of the common vernacular. If you have heard of terms like "doublethink" "thought crime" or "newspeak" you might be interested to read this story in order to understand their context. This is not a light hearted story at all, but rather a cautionary tale against a world which at one point it appeared we were heading towards, and unfortunately in my opinion not wholely averted.
