This books is a classic! It is very visionary and rightly predicts some societal trends towards totalitarianism. It is highly pessimistic, so don\'t expect a happy ending!!!!I disbelieve the claims that this book is written against religion. In the book, the Ruling Party, which is viewed negatively, is against religion--as we would define it. I find it much more probable to take the simple interpretation--it is written against political totalitarianism. Sure, atheists might like to have a good book like 1984 to trump their cause, but this book can not be understood properly within its literal/historical context without realizing that it strongly eludes to Soviet-style Communism and political totalitarianism in general.
