Having read this as a college freshman in 1962, I remembered the general concepts, but not the specifics of this novel. I was drawn to reacquaint myself with Winston and Big Brother as a result of the political and societal events of today. Although it was to have happened in 1984, it\'s tone and the level of control it describes is not far off from the direction we seem to be headed.  NSA, CIA, the "Justice Department", our court system, and the Secret Service fit in very nicely.
