I have a hard time putting this book down.  It is chilling how much control the government has.  We couldn\'t imagine having "telescreens" in our house that watch our every move.  "Big Brother" is always watching members of the Party.  People are heavily controlled.  The past is rewritten to fit with Party goals of the present.Honestly, though this book is far fetched in the scope of government control, I think it is riveting because we are seeing our civil liberties eroded away in America.  The government recently seized 2 months worth of phone records from the Associated Press, exposing their sources, which are supposed to be confidential.  Wiretaps are placed on people simply because of their religion.  Government whistleblowers are being prosecuted, such as a few who have blown the whistle about torture of detainees.  All of this says that our government is leaning towards more and more secrecy which is dangerous in a democracy.I highly recommend this book.  Thought provoking.  A classic.
