Having just read BRAVE NEW WORLD and some other books for school, I can honestly say that 1984 by Orwell is the scariest, deepest, most interesting, and undoubtedly the best book I\'ve ever read, with the possible exception of BARK OF THE DOGWOOD. When I started it, I couldn\'t put it down. When I finished it, I couldn\'t pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I\'ve finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can\'t sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It\'s ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it\'s at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I\'ve ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can\'t be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it\'s not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You\'ll never hear the phrase "Big Brother is watching you" again, without chills going down you\'re spine, and fear filling every corner of your being.  You must also read LORD OF THE FLIES for another chilling portrait of society gone wrong.
