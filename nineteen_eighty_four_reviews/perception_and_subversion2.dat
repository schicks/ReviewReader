To me it is somewhat surprising how few people think this is a book about perception and how that perception can be circumvented and subverted by the use of semantics. This should be obvious since Orwell actually takes the trouble to stop the book in mid-stride and lecture the reader about things like "doublethink". Jane Austen\'s "Pride and Prejudice" is also a book about perception, so much so that one of the Penguin Paperback editions has an entire introduction devoted to this idea. This is why Austen\'s book is still so timely and why "1984" is more timely than ever.The liberal left in America has had it\'s ability to reason literally overwhelmed in some instances by it\'s own political agenda. If Orwell could have I\'m sure he would have coined the phrase, "political correctness". Political correctness blinds a person to any solution that does not fit in with their world view and so America has become a very troubled place indeed; in America, rape by one group can be the result of \'generational rage\' and by another a predatory crime. Crime itself becomes politicized according to skin color. Words like \'colonialism\', and \'imperialism\' have had to be redefined by the Left in order to portray America in the light they wish. On the Left, it is taken for granted that all cultures are equal, separated only by opportunity and not by an inherent brilliance or lack of it; the benefits of  multiculturalism, as a result, are taken for granted and not to be even questioned and America\'s immigration policy reflects this tenet.The political Left in America in the 21st century has taken on the delusional aspects of the Right in the 1960,s, seeing what it wishes to see and deriding all else with an airy, moral wave of the hand. Obsessed with race, the Left projects its own obsession with skin color onto millions of white Americans it doesn\'t even know.The Left in America projects it\'s own oppressive and smothering presence onto the country as a whole in the name of political freedom while absolving America\'s criminal oppressors of guilt; it is the \'system\' that is guilty and the \'real\' criminal. Criminals become heros, and lack of achievement celebrated in patronizing asides while success itself is deemed immoral without regard to the intent of the opposite side of that success. Thus failure attains morality in an Orwellian way that is most troubling. The left assigns morality wholesale in stereotypes that consign a banker to spiritual bankruptcy and a college student the opposite in a bigoted default system totally unaware of it\'s own racism and lack of perception of reality.The political Left in America is caught in the very perceptual trap that Orwell warned about; that trap is insidious and blinds one to it\'s very walls.Lack of achievement in America on the part of certain groups in relegated to a concept of a generational hangover while achievement is deemed a result of privilege; in the eyes of the Left, both groups are in fact exactly equal in terms of competence.In America, the Left would have you believe that everyone is exactly equal, the "dictatorship of the proletariat" as it were in not a class struggle but an evening out of class, based on the \'coulda, woulda, shoulda\' view that there must be a reason why some groups achieve and others do not aside from their own endemic value system or lack of it. In this scenario success itself achieves a type of tainted corruption while lack of success is to be excused, examined, mitigated and measured in every possible way but what counts and that is as Orwellian as it gets."Big Brother" isn\'t watching everyone, just those it deems watchable by skin color, success and and entirely de-contextualized cultural history every bit as subversive as Winston\'s job.
