It amazing just how closely George Orwell\'s 1984 follows with the supposed modern USSR theory, which of course was never even get close to achieving. I would not be surprised to find that Orwell seeing how badly the English treated the Indians during his stays in India was or had a lot to do with his writing of 1984.I have to omit that while reading this story I felt a little scared as to how closely I see something\'s that are happening to us now and in the future. I think you will see so too. But on a personal note....No Sex!? Wow! No wonder everyone was so up tight. Lol A life time of celibacy would put anyone in the the mental ward. Even reading of the day to day life seemed to me as very depressing. At least sex would be a light at the end of the tunnel. To close. This story need to be read, because it shows the reader what could happen after we give up the fight for our freedom. And just how precious our freedom truly is. Read it and pass it along to two friends!
