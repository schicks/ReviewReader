George Orwell\'s final novel, 1984, was written amidst the anti-communist hysteria of the cold war.  But unlike Orwell\'s other famous political satire, Animal Farm, this novel is filled with bleak cynicism and grim pessimism about the human race.  When it was written, 1984 stood as a warning against the dangerous probabilities of communism.  And now today, after communism has crumbled with the Berlin Wall; 1984 has come back to tell us a tale of mass media, data mining, and their harrowing consequences.  It\'s 1984 in London, a city in the new \xfcberstate of Oceania, which contains what was once England, Western Europe and North America.  Our hero, Winston Smith works in the Ministry of Truth altering documents that contradict current government statements and opinions.  Winston begins to remember the past that he has worked so hard to destroy, and turns against The Party.  Even Winston\'s quiet, practically undetectable form of anarchism is dangerous in a world filled with thought police and the omnipresent two-way telescreen.  He fears his inevitable capture and punishment, but feels no compulsion to change his ways.  Winston\'s dismal observations about human nature are accompanied by the hope that good will triumph over evil; a hope that Orwell does not appear to share.  The people of Oceania are in the process of stripping down the English language to its bones.  Creating Newspeak, which Orwell uses only for examples and ideas which exist only in the novel.  The integration of Newspeak into the conversation of the book.  One of the new words created is doublethink, the act of believing that two conflicting realities exist.  Such as when Winston sees a photograph of a non-person, but must reason that that person does not, nor ever has, existed. The inspiration for Winston\'s work ,may have come from Russia.  Where Stalin\'s right-hand man, Trotzky was erased from all tangible records after his dissention from the party.  And the fear of telescreens harks back to the days when Stasi bugs were hooked to every bedpost, phone line and light bulb in Eastern Europe. His reference to Hitler Youth, the Junior Spies, which trains children to keep an eye out for thought criminals- even if they are their parents; provides evidence for Orwell\'s continuing presence in pop culture.  "Where men can\'t walk, or freely talk, And sons turn their fathers in." is a line from U2\'s 1993 song titled "The Wanderer".Orwell assumes that we will pick up on these political allusions. But the average grade 11 student will probably only have a vague understanding of these due to lack of knowledge.  It is even less likely that they will pick up on the universality of these happenings, like the fact that people still "disappear" without a trace every day in Latin America.Overall, however, the book could not have been better written.  Orwell has created characters and events that are scarily realistic.  Winston\'s narration brings the reader inside his head, and sympathetic with the cause of the would-be-rebels.  There are no clear answers in the book, and it\'s often the reader who has to decide what to believe.  But despite a slightly unresolved plot, the book serves its purpose.  Orwell wrote this book to raise questions; and the sort of questions he raised have no easy answer.  This aspect can make the novel somewhat of a disappointment for someone in search of a light read.  But anyone prepared to not just read, but think about a novel, will get a lot out of 1984.1984, is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is a gruesome, saddening portrait of humanity, with it\'s pitfalls garishly highlighted.  Its historic importance has never been underestimated; and it\'s reemergence as a political warning for the 21st century makes it deserving of a second look.  Winston\'s world of paranoia and inconsistent realities is  an eloquently worded account of a future we thought we buried in our past; but in truth may be waiting just around the corner.
