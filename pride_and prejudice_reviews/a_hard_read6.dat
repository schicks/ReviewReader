Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite.  The central character is not likeable and you can\'t sympathasize with her.  It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived.  If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense &amp; Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading.
