Wow!  What else do you say after you read such an incredible book?  Jane Austen\'s timeless characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, Miss Bingley(oh, don\'t you just love to hate her), Jane, etc. all add to this  intricately woven plot.  Elizabeth Bennett is arguably one of the most  complex characters ever written (well, Lucy Snowe of Villette wins the  prize).  This novel is an excellent example of Austen\'s literary power.  Her heroines are to be admired for they all dared to marry for love and not  for social status which so often happened to women in their predicament  back then.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will be angry, and above all,  you will fall in love with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  However, don\'t stop  after Pride and Prejudice; read Sense and Sensibility, read Emma, read them  all. (It won\'t take long; she only wrote six- I was disappointed that there  weren\'t more) Jane Austen\'s work is incredible; the only fault I find is  that she has so many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all.  Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and  everybody.  But it won\'t be a chore to read it again, more like opening a  treasure chest.
