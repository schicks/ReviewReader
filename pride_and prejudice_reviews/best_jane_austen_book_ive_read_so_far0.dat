I\'ve read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging.  The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human.  You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her.  The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse.  She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker.  She has just matched her former governess, "Poor Miss Taylor," up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success.  Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister\'s (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn\'t take him seriously.  Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet.  Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal.  Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him.  Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead.  She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston\'s son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back.  She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down.  Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come.  Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family.  Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend\'s husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed.  Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her.  Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate.  Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him.  Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it.  Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley.  Then another problem arises.  I don\'t want to say too much more because I don\'t want to spoil the story if you don\'t know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved.  But it\'s a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick.
