"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves; vanity, to what we would have others think of us."  Jane AustenI let my own foolish pride, my own ignorant prejudices; deter me from ever picking up a Jane Austen achievement until about a month ago when I finally decided to give her a shot.  This classic novel was definitely not on my `must read\' list, but somehow, someway, it landed on my lap one afternoon and I decided to at least take a quick peek at it while no one else was looking.  After all, a man\'s man like myself (whatever that means nowadays) has no time to read early 19th century Chick Brit Lit., let alone a sweet, love story like this one.  Especially during football season!  I could almost hear Bukowski\'s ghost laughing at me when I opened up the first page and read those unforgettable first lines regarding man and marriage.  However, I forged on, just Jane and I, and when it was all said and done - I can\'t believe what a fool I\'ve been all these years!  Yes, this classic is a thing of beauty.  And like Jane\'s main protagonist and narrative voice in the novel - Elizabeth Bennet - I too learned a valuable lesson about not judging a book by its cover.  Isn\'t evolution great?Don\'t make the same mistake I did.  I love classic literature, but for too long now I avoided such greats as the Bronte\'s, Wharton, Cather, et al... because of my foolish male ego, my ridiculous machismo pride.  My biggest regret though, was avoiding Austen all these years.  Now, I may not go out and rent the movie anytime soon (of course the wife made me promise that I would watch it with her after I introduced her to "Scarface" the other night), but I will definitely be purchasing some more of Jane\'s classics (Emma, Persuasion, Mansfield Park, etc...) and if they are anything like this pleasant surprise, I am going to be one happy camper.Never a dull moment, never a page not worth perusing, simply put - Austen is awesome!
