This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming.  However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold.  The preface by George Saintsbury is one of my least favorite of any P &amp; P edition I have read.  Overall, I\'m glad to own this copy, but I often read my Penguin Classics paperback copy instead.
