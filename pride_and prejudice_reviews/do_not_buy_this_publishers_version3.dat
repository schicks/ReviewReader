I ordered three novels by Jane Austen for a class.  It was my misfortune that all three were published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.  All three are unacceptable.  Pride and Prejudice and Emma have no page numbers, chapters start in the middle of the page, and the books are physically too large to hold comfortably.  Sense and Sensibility is physically smaller, but the type is so small as to be unreadable, and pages from a completely unrelated book are bound in the middle.  Look for copies of these novels from another publisher.
