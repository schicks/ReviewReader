"Emma" was the first Jane Austen book I read, and after reading all of Austen\'s novels, it is still my favorite.  The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end.  Indeed, I couldn\'t put the book  down until I finished it.  For those who think that it is too difficult a  read, try it.  I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it  immensely.  Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the  movie Clueless, which was based on "Emma".  Clueless was made in  the 1990\'s, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700\'s and died in her  forties.  It is rather obvious that "Emma" came first. I know  this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were  during English class.  Back to the book, though - I loved it and would  recommend it to anyone!
