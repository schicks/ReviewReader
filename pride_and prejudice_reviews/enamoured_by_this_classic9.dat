Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. This was the first English classic book I read while getting my University degree. Pride and Prejudice was a part of my English Literature. What began as a course syllabus, ended as a love affair with English classic, specially books by Jane Austen.This book strengthened by belief that love withstands everything. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are so excellently chalked out, that it makes us fall for them instantly. The magic of this book is amazing.This book lead me to buy and read all Jane Austen\'s classics.Must read for all who love to read..
