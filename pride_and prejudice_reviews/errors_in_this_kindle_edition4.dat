There are numerous errors in this Kindle version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Most of them are simple copyediting mistakes but occasionally dropped words entirely change the meaning of a sentence.This is NOT the way to experience one of the greatest novels in the English language. Amazon says that you save $3 and change by downloading this free Kindle version but what you lose is much more than that.This ebook should be replaced. Students should consult a professionally published version (Penguin, Oxford University Press) before writing papers or using quotations.
