I confess I experienced "flutterings" when I received this book. It is gorgeous beyond belief, and I do not exaggerate. Presented in an oversized format, in hardcover, and beautifully bound in cloth in a rich mustard color, this is a richly annotated and gloriously illustrated edition of one of the most popular novels in classic English literature. Edited by University of Virginia Professor, Patricia Meyer Spacks, the novel by Jane Austen is accompanied by rich insights that afford devoted fans and those new to the novel a more in-depth look into a story that has become dear to so many.The text chosen for this annotated edition is from the first edition, published in 1813. There is a lengthy introduction by Ms. Spacks, addressing pertinent matters such as Austen\'s life,her work, the enduring appeal of Pride and Prejudice and how it has affected the general consciousness, and predictably, the merits of literary annotation. Besides the annotations, the work is enriched with the inclusion of numerous illustrations, including movie posters associated with the dramatizations of P&amp;P; illustrations and engravings of fashions during the period the novel was set in (bonnets, dress typically worn by gentlewomen and gentlemen of the time); portraits of authors that influenced Austen\'s work (e.g. popular novelist Maria Edgeworth); numerous other portraits/ paintings/photographs that depict life during Jane Austen\'s lifetime; and many more. I found it refreshing that instead of placing familiar illustrations depicting scenes from the novel itself, Ms. Spacks has chosen illustrations and photographs of places from Austen\'s life, and could very well have inspired Austen in her works.As for the annotations, they are of immense help to the Austen novice as there are handy explanations as to the meaning of certain words/ phrases not commonly used the way they were back then. The devoted Austen fan will delight in the fact-based annotations that serve to explain or observe the conventions of society during the period. Then there\'s Ms. Spacks own observations on events in the novel which enhance one\'s reading experience as the reader gains a fresh perspective as to the motivations of the novel\'s characters. In all, this is a treasure trove of insights and knowledge that have truly enriched my own understanding of P&amp;P. I now eagerly await the Annotated Persuasion!
