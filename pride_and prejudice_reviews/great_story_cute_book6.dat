This is a nice copy of the book.  It has a built in ribbon bookmark and nice line drawing illustrations.  It is about 3 inches wide and 5 inches long (smaller than a standard book).  It is a very pretty version of the book though, and would be great as a gift.  Seems like it is well made.  It does have thin pages, but it doesn\'t seem problematic.
