My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it!  As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know!  It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane  Austen\'s insight on human nature.  Her characters are very realistic in my  opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen\'s time in  England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be  excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to  the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to  read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got  about a third of the way through the book.  I just couldn\'t understand it  well enough.  I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to  give it another chance.  See one of the excellent videos first if you don\'t  understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is  so much better!  I know that reading it has expanded my ability to  appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen\'s  novels now.
