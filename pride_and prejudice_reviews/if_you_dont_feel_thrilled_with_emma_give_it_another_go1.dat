I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn\'t get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma\'s words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen\'s prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles\' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn\'t go. Austen doesn\'t say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn\'t like it, try it again.
