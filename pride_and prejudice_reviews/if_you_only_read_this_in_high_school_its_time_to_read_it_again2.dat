Okay, I admit it:  I read Pride and Prejudice in high school and didn\'t like it.  However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull.  In recent years, I\'ve read most of Jane Austen\'s other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Pride and Prejudice.The story is familiar to most:  it centers around the five young Bennett sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother).  And then there are the men, for as the novel\'s opening line notes: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."  Such a man, Mr. Bingley, buys a house close to the Bennett family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Bennett girl, Jane.  Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Mr. Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Elizabeth, the strong-minded second Bennett daughter.  And from the pride held by each of the four principle characters described above (but namely Darcy and Elizabeth), Austen derives her prejudice.In many ways, Pride and Prejudice reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps.  Similarly, the embarrassment which Jane and Elizabeth suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today\'s reality TV.  But of course, Austen\'s writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day.
