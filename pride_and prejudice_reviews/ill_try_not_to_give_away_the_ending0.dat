Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime.  While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or  satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the  landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around  Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac  father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and  neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen\'s characterisation is  delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant  comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like  Dickens\' characters sometimes do.  Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex  mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and  self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised.  Austen\'s dialogue is as  delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer  nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or  otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a  happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine  positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is  sure.  Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read.
