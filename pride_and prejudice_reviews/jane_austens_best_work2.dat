This is my favourite book in the world!!  This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read "Pride and Prejuduce" several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Darcy snub and then fall for the prejudice Lizzy, who is far from willing to give him a chance.  However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy\'s father, Mr Bennett, is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Austen\'s books.  Mrs Bennett is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her!  Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Darcy.  I have to agree with Jane Austen, as her favourite character of her books is Miss Elizabeth Bennett.This is a book that can be read time and time again.  Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down.  If you ever get a chance to watch the BBC TV series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it\'s 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Jane Austen wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years.
