I literally SWOONED when I saw this copy of Emma: An Annotated Edition edited by Bharat Tandon. I have cherished this annotated series of Jane Austen\'s novels by Harvard University Press, including the Annotated Pride and Prejudice and the Annotated Persuasion.Foremost, the books are lushly illustrated, beautifully produced, and well-researched by known Jane Austen scholars. Jane Austen Emma: An Annotated Edition is no exception. Considering the beautiful package, the book is very reasonably priced at $35 U.S. (reduced at Amazon), a perfect gift for the Janeite or historian in your family. Jane Austen Emma: Annotated Edition begins with a comprehensive introduction by Bharat Tandon, an academic, writer, and reviewer who has lectured at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and specializing in teaching British literature after 1700, and American literature after 1900.Emma is the only novel Jane Austen named after her heroine. Although she was fond of her eponymous character, she did not foresee Emma becoming a general favorite with the reading public, saying, \'I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\' Truth be told, I\'ve never quite warmed up to Emma Woodhouse, but in relation to other novels my dislike is minor.Her father, Mr. Woodhouse, on the other hand, has completely won me over with his odd, endearing hypochondriac ways, encouraging Mrs. Bates to eat a soft boiled egg and a very little bit of apple-tart, and a small half glass of wine put into a tumbler of water. Later in the novel, Mr. Woodhouse engages in a discussion with Frank Churchill about the room at the Crown, in which Frank tries to reassure the older man that the room engaged for the ball will be so large that there would be no occasion to open the windows and let in cold air upon heated bodies. Mr. Woodhouse nearly goes apoplectic at the thought, for both men are convinced that sweaty bodies should not be exposed to fresh air, a concept wonderfully explained by Tandon in his annotation, which quotes The Code of Health and Longevity by John Sinclair (1807)."They were stopping,however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates\'s; whose house was a little nearer Tandalls than Ford\'s; and had ll but knocked, when Emma caught their eye. - Immediately the crossed the road and came forward to her." I was astonished to discover in this book that Jane Austen\'s use of \'catching an eye\' was one of the earliest citations of that particular use of that phrase in the OED, which has cited Pride and Prejudice in the instance when Darcy catches Elizabeth\'s eye and withdrew his own.Tandon discusses the meaning of making an entrance, the etiquette of dinner seating, square pianos, the plight of governesses, and so forth. Annotated books are such treasures for the serious reader of Jane Austen\'s novels, explaining her words and old-fashioned idioms and making long dead customs come alive. This lushly illustrated annotation from Harvard University Press both instructs and entertains with its running commentary along the margins, enhancing our enjoyment of one of Jane Austen\'s most perfectly realized novels.This edition, cover and all, is absolutely beautiful. Five stars.
