"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife".  That\'s how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting  better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main  characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true  love in pre-Victorian England.  Elizabeth is a gentleman\'s daughter and Mr.  Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters,  are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to  their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries.  Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying  well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until  Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and  accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Bingley becomes  captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth\'s eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has  an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and  can she see past his pride in order for them to get together?  That\'s the  question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try  and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I\'ve been doing  that for a few years, and yet, it\'s always fresh when a get around to  reading it.
