I adore and revere Austen and this book is, for me, the pinnacle.  It\'s such a masterwork of the English language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Austen lived.  Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Austen becomes apparent.Was Austen a feminist?  I\'m not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked.  She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband.  A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated.  This is why Austen and her most bewitching heroine Elizabeth are so very subversive.  Austen\'s creation, like Austen herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms.  She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today\'s reader, it was anything but in an age when  money and status meant everything.  Elizabeth is not perfect.  She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Austen makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention.  Though Elizabeth\'s dear friend Charlotte makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Charlotte is simply doing what she must to survive.  It is not that Charlotte is any less true to herself than Elizabeth, it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic.  She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils.  I think that Austen respected this as well.  Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Darcy, he is also a product of his time.  He behaves in a way that society feels a man should.  At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father\'s trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family\'s kindness.  He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts.  There are few in whom Darcy can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him.  Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one.  Darcy is no more free to do whatever he likes than Elizabeth is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances.  At heart, Austen was a romantic.  She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment.  She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves.  I think it is this optimism that makes Austen so appealing to her readers.
