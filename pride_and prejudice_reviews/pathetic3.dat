This is a long book and you don\'t want to put up with the terrible formatting, spelling, etc.  I uploaded a picture of one page of this book.  Take a look.I then purchased "Pride and Prejudice (Illustrated Edition) by Jane Austen, Charles Edmund Brock and George Saintsbury (Jun 26, 2013) - Kindle eBook" for an extra dollar and everything is as it should be.  Wonderful illustrations are a plus too!
