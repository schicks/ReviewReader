I am really enjoying this book. I won\'t comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the kindle version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast.
