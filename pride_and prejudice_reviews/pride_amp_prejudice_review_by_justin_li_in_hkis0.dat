This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book.  Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature. British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers.  The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century.  The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens\' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living. Reading Jane Austen\'s work is always a pleasure.  It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling.
