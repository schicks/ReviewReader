I have read "pride and Prejudic" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. "Pride and Prujudice" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and  stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth\'s gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy\'s love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other?  Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too.
