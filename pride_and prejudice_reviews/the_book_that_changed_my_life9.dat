I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum.  (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.)  I asked if we could browse in the book store.  Half an hour later, we  emerged.  I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of  \'Pride and Prejudice\'.  As soon as we got in the car I started reading.  I  finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning.  Even  at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece.  In the 15 years  since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous  times.  It just keeps getting better and better.  Elizabeth was my idol.  Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney\'s \'Sleeping Beauty\'), as the man  of my dreams.  Mrs Bennett\'s nerves began to irk me as much as they did the  long-suffering Mr Bennett.  I love this book and I can\'t even begin to  praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough.  If you haven\'t read it -  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  If you have read it, I think its time to get it  off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of \'Pride  and Prejudice\' all over again.
