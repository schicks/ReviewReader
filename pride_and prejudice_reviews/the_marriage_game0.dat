The "truth universally acknowledged" that begins Jane Austen\'s "Pride and Prejudice" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England.  The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.The novel\'s heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family.  Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters.  Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.Jane, Elizabeth\'s older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his.  Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley\'s attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy.  Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead.  Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy\'s father and who became Darcy\'s father\'s ward after his own father\'s death, enters the story.  To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten.  Wickham risks damaging the Bennets\' reputation when Elizabeth\'s youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.If the "pride" in the novel is Darcy\'s self-regard, the "prejudice" is Elizabeth\'s initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all.  He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him.  It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of "The Taming of the Shrew," that distinguishes Austen\'s novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature.
