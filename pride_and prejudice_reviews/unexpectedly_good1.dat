I had to read "Emma" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all.  Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try "Pride and Prejudice".  The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go).  Austen\'s characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute.  The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening.  Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like "Emma") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you\'ll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending.
