I first watched the movie, never took any eager interest in british literature or period movies before. This movie just inspired me and I just had to buy Pride and Prejudice in this cover because I fell in love with Matthew Macfadyen as Mr.Darcy and Keira Knightley as Miss Elizabeth Bennett. The book like any other publisher of Pride and Prejudice, they have the same contents although this book have some explanations at the back for words like "chaise and four" and etc. for people that never read books like this before. I love it so much so now I\'m hunting for all Jane Austens\' books and movies!!!
