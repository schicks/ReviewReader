My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight.  I didn\'t get it.  For reasons lost in the mists of history, I  picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn\'t  put it down.  Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Austen  ever wrote, and was a member of the Jane Austen Club back in the early  \'80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I\'ve learned from my  frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a  little more than I did the last time.  Her language appears convoluted to  us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly  because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever  lived.  So do we denigrate Shakespeare or Chaucer for their voices?The  themes of Austen\'s works are all similar - they all relate to the  difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured  society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives.  In  fact, when I visited her burial place in Winchester Cathedral, I was  surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy  narrative about her, until I realized that there was NOT ONE WORD about her  writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father  and family.  So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there  was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of  parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which  appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and  somewhat pathetic.  (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today  to find their own rich, indulgent Mr. Darcys... especially in light of  their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Austen\'s writing  that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of  the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is not  one word about the greater world.  I doubt that the word "London"  appears in any of them except briefly in "Sense and Sensibility";  they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of  England, and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk.  The novels were written at the end of the Napoleonic era and the beginning  of the Industrial Revolution, so there was plenty of upheaval, social and  otherwise, occuring all over England and the Continent, but nary a whisper  of it ever rears its ugly head in her works.  She holds her magnifying  glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely  microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that\'s part of her genius.  She  can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in  its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of  the tree.  Good?  Bad?  I don\'t know, and I think it doesn\'t matter - but  there is probably not a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of  time and place in all of English literature.I am torn between being glad  that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it  is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is  buried.  I  only hope, for those who were force-fed on Austen and others of her ilk,  that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive  from them the pleasure that is there for the asking.  Meanwhile, I strongly  recommend periodic infusions of all of Austen\'s works, of which I believe  "Pride and Prejudice" is the most accessible.
