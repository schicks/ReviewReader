Lord of the Rings deserves a beautiful edition, and this is NOT it!  The "Millennium Edition," which looks so nice in photographs, is in fact small (each volume is about the size of a trade paperback), badly  printed on poor paper, and exceedingly shoddily made (the first time I  opened a volume in a bookstore, the binding split right through).  The  volumes are not even real hardcovers, just paperbacks stuck in thin, skimpy  covers of shiny board.I REPEAT:  this is a lousy edition, grossly  overpriced!  Beware  of it!  You\'d be much better off with a set of  paperbacks you could replace for $15.
