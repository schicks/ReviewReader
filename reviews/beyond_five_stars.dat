I have already read this excellent and marvelous book (and am sure that many other viewers have too). I am not here to review the contents of it, since many other reviewers have already written what I wanted to say. I want to comment on a particular edition, the One-Volume Hardcover 50th anniversary edition. I wanted a sturdy, well-made copy of the Lord of the Rings, but was not willing to buy the expensive collector\'s edition. So I searched for an alternative, and I found this. It is less than half of the collector\'s edition price, with the same 50th Anniversary text. Plus, it is a sturdy copy, and well-bound. It has the same illustration on its dust jacket as the paper-back edition, illustrated by renoun artist Alan Lee. The best thing about this edition, though, is its pages. It is not the regular kind of acid-free paper, it is a strong, almost shiny paper (no, it doesn\'t hurt the eyes); it is hard to explain, but you\'ll know what I mean by this if you get it. This book is a beautiful, well-made copy of Lord of the Rings that will last for a very long time. Get this one.As a side-note, I bought my friend the paperback version of this book as a present (she being a Tolkien Fan and in need of a replacement for her beaten up copy) and found that the paperback is also a wonderful alternative to buy for one who doesn\'t want a hardcover edition. It is a sturdy and pretty copy, and though the paper in the paperback is not of the quality of the hardcover, it is acid free. Plus it has the revised text.
