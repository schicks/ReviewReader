Purchased the Kindle Edition in the second week of November, 2009. I believe this was sourced from the 2002 LOTR edition and is currently the latest -- this is indicated in the "Note on the 50th Anniversary Edition" included in the Kindle Edition.I\'m pretty much through it and have found only one slight format problem in chapter 5 (Fellowship of the Ring) with two words stuck together.  All of the maps come through and can be enlarged.  However, it really is nice to be able to go online and look at full color maps on a 30" monitor but the Kindle maps are OK.  Also, the clickable footnotes are a huge plus!  The Tolkien spellings are true, and the format is quite nice -- italics for the songs along with a correct symbol representation of the "fire writing" and runes where they show up.  Anybody who owns a Kindle and loves LOTR would do well with this edition.
