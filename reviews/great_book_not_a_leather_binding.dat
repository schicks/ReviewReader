Only an balrog could object to an revised 50th anniversary edition, with corrections beyond those in the the standard revised version. BUT...This is *not* a leather binding: it\'s a very ordinary hardcover edition with paper-thin faux leather glued over paper boards. The bookmark ribbon breaks the binding. Signatures glued rather than sewn together, not held together by the \'leather,\' separated from paper spine. Poor production generally: end papers badly centered, more than a little random glue and rubber cement on the covers that really mars the appearance. Mine is the second printing, I do not see the poor type-setting complained of by other reviewers.Look at Customer Image #18 to see for your self.It\'s an OK one-volume edition, given the revisions and illustrations. *NOT* a \'collectible\', barely worth the discounted $56 given the disappointment factor. *Don\'t* give this as a gift to a Tolkien fan, expecting rapture.Calling this \'leather bound\' is *serious* misrepresentation of the product.
