First: Amazon\'s rating method--i.e, that all editions of the same work are included under one rating thread--is useless.  This Millennium edition is a rip-off--cheaply bound, printed on cheap paper, small print  (paperback-like), no illustrations--DON\'T buy it--buy one of the  well-establishhed, illustrated hardcover editions.  Tolkien\'s work itself,  of course, rates all the stars there are.
