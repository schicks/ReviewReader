186Since at this point these books no longer need an introduction, I might as well go straight into the review of this edition, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It features leatherette covers, which are soft and very well made. The colors are less saturated than they are in Proper_Noun picture, but that is for the better. They are definitely nice and easy to hold, and the "stand" it comes with is sturdy and beautiful. I decided to put them in my desk, and they could not have gotten a better place. The only complaint that might arise is that the font is small, but that is to be expected from a "pocket" edition, and it is readable anyway. Overall, the quality of this edition is magnificent. If you are a fan, this relatively inexpensive set should definitely be added to your collection. If you haven\'t read the books, stop reading this and go buy them. Seriously. Now.
