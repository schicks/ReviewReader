544I am posting my review of this edition (deluxe pocket boxed set) because Proper_Noun appears to merge the reviews of various editions. Since I have already reviewed another edition, it would not permit me to review this one, so I searched for a third party submission to post my review.The content of the books is well known by most who would be drawn to this set, so I will not focus my review on that.This edition is a dream come true for me as a collector of classic literature in small format. I always like to carry a good book with me and a small size is very convenient. If editions of Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun are available in quality pocket editions, why not the greatest work in the fantasy genre? I guess enough people, including me, said it and the publisher listened. The books are roughly 4 x6 inches making them smaller than a pulp paperback. The covers are a flexible plastic somewhat resembling leather which is deeply embossed with the titles. It seems like it would last well, but time will only tell.The paper is a creamy white and the bindings are sewn rather than glued (a huge plus in my opinion).The print is small as one would expect when cramming such a huge work onto such a small format. It\'s still plenty legible to me. This edition appears to be a photographic reproduction of a recently corrected edition. The image quality is somewhat rough but still very readable. I can understand why they went that route. LOTR has quite a history of printer\'s errors creeping in every time the typeface has been reset.Even with it\'s minor flaws I am extremely happy with this set and it gets a solid five stars from me.544I am posting my review of this edition (deluxe pocket boxed set) because Proper_Noun appears to merge the reviews of various editions.
