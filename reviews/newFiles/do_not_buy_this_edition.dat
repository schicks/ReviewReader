544Everyone knows the Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of the Rings are wonderful stories, and I fully agree. The reason for my bad rating of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun works is that the books are riddled with typographical errors, some so severe that they change the meaning of sentences, effectively reversing the author\'s intent. One example: "The Proper_Noun locked their doors at night, which was also not unusual in the Proper_Noun The word "unusual" should have been "usual"--i.e., the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun don\'t usually lock their doors at night. But exactly the opposite idea is conveyed by Proper_Noun typographical error! And there are many more errors where that one came from. I counted Proper_Noun errors on ONE Proper_Noun AVOID Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at all costs!
