862In view of the newly found popularity of Proper_Noun classic, I decided to update my old Proper_Noun Proper_Noun edition of Proper_Noun I compared several editions out there (Boxed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the sober Harper-Collins with the black cover and the single ring in the centre), and decided to buy this one. It is, hands down, the best.The folding maps need some care, if you\'re like me and try to keep your books as if they were brand new. Overall, it\'s very well put together and makes a great addition to my library.I\'m sorry if this review seems superficial, but I feel all that should be written about the books themselves has already been written--and perhaps more. Suffice to say that this is the edition for the true fan of the books, although the whole thing makes a rather big (and elegant) tome to carry around the house.If you want your children to read it, perhaps a less intimidating edition would be in order, though (my old Proper_Noun set is ideal for that, and it\'s making its way to the younger in the family).
