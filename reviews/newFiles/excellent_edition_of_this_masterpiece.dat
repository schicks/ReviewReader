42Like so many others, I won\'t review the novel here. It\'s the best. Read it.This edition, however, puts all the others to shame. It\'s beautifully printed on extremely high-quality paper, and designed to last. the illustrations are beautiful, and there are just enough of them. Not so many to make it a picture book, if you know what I mean. It doesn\'t have fold-out maps, but I already have them with my old 2nd editon and the book of the maps of middle earth. The actual back and cover and binding are real cloth-bound and heavy duty. Plus they are red as they should be. (think red book of Proper_Noun This book will last.Also, I Proper_Noun recommend this over any of the one-volume editions for one big reason.Weight.It\'s just too much to hold that big huge 50th anniversary edition in your lap and read. I\'ve had some of the smaller one-volume editions of this book, too, and I gave \'em away, because when I read it, I want to be comfortable.
