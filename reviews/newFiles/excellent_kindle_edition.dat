99Purchased the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the second week of Proper_Noun 2009. I believe this was sourced from the 2002 Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and is currently the latest -- this is indicated in the "Note on the 50th Proper_Noun Proper_Noun included in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun pretty much through it and have found only one slight format problem in chapter 5 (Fellowship of the Proper_Noun with two words stuck together. All of the maps come through and can be enlarged. However, it really is nice to be able to go online and look at full color maps on a 30" monitor but the Proper_Noun maps are Proper_Noun Also, the clickable footnotes are a huge plus! The Proper_Noun spellings are true, and the format is quite nice -- italics for the songs along with a correct symbol representation of the Proper_Noun writing" and runes where they show up. Anybody who owns a Proper_Noun and loves Proper_Noun would do well with this edition.
