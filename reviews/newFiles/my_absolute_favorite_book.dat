73This is not a review of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Its having been voted Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun here on Proper_Noun says more than enough about the worth of Proper_Noun work. Rather, it is a review of the several hardcover editions of this fantastic story.There are for major hardcover editions of Proper_Noun all published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They are essentially the same price, so I will not take that into consideration.The best of the editions (5 stars) is the blue Proper_Noun Proper_Noun illustrated version printed in Proper_Noun 1991. I have owned this Proper_Noun for several years, and read it three times. It is durable, beautiful, and has no flaws that I have found. The illustrations are wonderful, though most Proper_Noun fans will have seen these pictures before.The red edition printed in Proper_Noun 1974 is also a solid edition of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun stars). It is every bit as good as the blue version, but does not have the illustrations. If you are the type of reader that prefers to leave everything to your imagination, this is the version for you.Both the blue and red versions have matching editions of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 1997 or Proper_Noun 1973, respectively). I found both of these editions to be satisfactory.The other two major editions of Proper_Noun - the white three-volume edition from Proper_Noun 1988 and the black seven-volume edition from Proper_Noun 2000 - are not recommended (2 stars). The print quality in both is poor, and the durability is less than that of the red and blue versions. The only advantage of these editions is portability, as the red and blue versions are single-volume and quite hefty.Ramble on....
