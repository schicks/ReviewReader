80Houghton Proper_Noun Proper_Noun published three editions of the one-volume Proper_Noun all of which include the complete text and the appendices:This 1991 centennial edition has largest text. It includes durable binding, smooth white pages, glossy illustrations, an illustrated Proper_Noun jacket, and an red ribbon bookmark sewn into the binding. However, the book is the largest Proper_Noun book Proper_Noun ever seen in my life -- Proper_Noun quite hefty.There is a red, faux-leather collector\'s edition published in 1974. It is slightly smaller in dimensions compared to the centennial edition and weighs considerably less. The Proper_Noun is beautiful and unmatched in elegance. Chapter headings and margin headings are in orange red. The pages are slightly tinted yellow, as smooth as the centennial edition, and seem to emit a pleasant flagrance. However, there is "broken type" on nearly every page because the text is not conventionally set, but rather a photo offset from another edition. (Conventionally set text would read like a Proper_Noun document printed with a laser printer. Photo offset would be as if one had scanned that laser-printed Proper_Noun document into a Proper_Noun and reprinted out that Proper_Noun The binding of this edition also seems to be of lesser quality than the 1991 centennial edition.There is also the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun edition printed in Proper_Noun of 2001. Like the centennial edition\'s Proper_Noun illustration, this edition\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is also on a Proper_Noun jacket. I am not too familiar with this edition, but from casual browsing, Proper_Noun found that the text, though smallest, looks the most "conventionally set," and the pages are of the same quality as the centennial edition. The book is smaller in height and width but thicker than the collector\'s edition. The binding looks solid enough, but there is no Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the book.My personal favorite is the centennial edition.
