79This is Proper_Noun a review of Proper_Noun It is, rather, specifically about the "Hardcover boxed, Proper_Noun edition Proper_Noun 1999)" from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun First off, Proper_Noun is divided here into six volumes (plus a volume of appendix material) -- Proper_Noun the three volumes one usually sees. The titles of the three usual volumes have therefore changed; but it\'s Proper_Noun stated where the new titles came from. Are they from Proper_Noun himself? From his son? Or from some lesser source? (Yes, I know, the original Proper_Noun has Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun etc.-- but Proper_Noun different titles for Proper_Noun of these). Second, on the whole these "hardcovers" look a little cheesy to me. The bindings certainly aren\'t leather: They look kinda like nothing more than cardboard with a glossy lamination. The books\' spines have no Proper_Noun either: Proper_Noun too, are of stiff, unbending cardboard. And finally, it doesn\'t appear that the paper on which this "Millennium Proper_Noun is printed is acid-free (which lasts longer and doesn\'t yellow with age). Like the covers, the paper also appears, to my eye, a little cheap. (If a book\'s paper is acid-free, that fact is usually stated on the copyright page.) So all in all the Proper_Noun aspects of this edition (epecially at a list price of Proper_Noun seem suspiciously second-rate. On the positive side, this edition claims to be free of a large number of typographical errors, misprints, and other textual mistakes that marred earlier editions. Also a plus: The maps of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun here are clearer and easier to read than those in earlier editions. Yet even this has a down side, however: These nice maps appear Proper_Noun in the 7th and final volume of the boxed set, i.e., in the appendices! Why, oh, Proper_Noun weren\'t the maps run in Proper_Noun of the six volumes of the story, so that a Proper_Noun could easily glance at a map as the tale progresses from volume to volume? Some of the volumes in this edition have several *blank* pages at the end, and therefore they could EASILY have accommodated the maps! Wasn\'t anybody thinking of the Proper_Noun when this edition was put together?
