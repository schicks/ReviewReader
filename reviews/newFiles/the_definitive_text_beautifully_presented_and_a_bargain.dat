1,024Addendum Proper_Noun 2008:Let me say that while there may be finer editions (the 2000 Proper_Noun black leather/india paper (now over $300US) and the 2004 Proper_Noun 50th Proper_Noun Proper_Noun edition (still in print, but over Proper_Noun where available), this Proper_Noun 50th Proper_Noun edition is easily the best edition in print in the Proper_Noun Despite some complaints and comments by other reviewers to the contrary, this book is in fact leather bound. Many readers will have only had experience with a style of leather binding now rare Proper_Noun or morocco leather) that was quite heavy and very expensive. As an amateur bookbinder, typesetter, and papermaker who has studied with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and others, I can say with absolute confidence that the binding on this edition is a type of elegant, thin leather formerly much used, known as "bonded leather", it is infact and deed: leather.Having set that issue to rest, let me also say that the other design and manufacturing consideration of the edition are first rate. I should say it would be a bargain of it were just cloth bound, and it should occupy a place of pride in anyone\'s library, and become a suitable heirloom. Have no fear if you are looking for the best in-print edition of Proper_Noun You will get it with this one.Two fine points. If you prefer an illustrated edition, perhaps the Proper_Noun one-volume edition illustrated by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is more suitable. No slipcase, a cloth binding, and the text, unlike this edition, does not reflect the most recent corrections (this and the lower priced 50th Proper_Noun "Standard" edition are the only editions in the Proper_Noun which do). Also, this edition is sometimes confused with an earlier commemorative published around 2000-2001 from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that was famously defective in its production, with missing or torn pages, improperly sewn or bound pages and signatures, and all around sloppy construction. They sound and look similar, but always check the Proper_Noun and be sure that you are looking at the correct edition Proper_Noun should have a preface by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Hammond regarding the text corrections). This edition, whatever other opinions may be, has had no such manufacturing problems, and is for the moment the definitive text of Proper_Noun 2007:Beware that many of the reviews posted here for this edition do appear to actually refer to another, slightly earlier edition that was defective. While I can\'t provide Proper_Noun numbers, there was another commemorative edition published shortly before this one (and which was also slipcased in a black leather binding with gilt edges) that of a limited edition of 1500 copies, 1100 were recalled by the publisher due to defects in the binding and assembly, specifically the problems listed here of bad cutting and gluing etc. This edition here is that which was brought out to replace it. It contains the Proper_Noun paintings and different cover art from the earlier one, and can be distinguished from it on this basis at least. I bought my copy from Proper_Noun last year and it is perfect. I have examined at least 3 other new copies at bookstores and each of those was also as it should be. I have also seen a used copy of the earlier defective and it is clearly not the same edition, though I imagine it will become valuable due to scarcity in time (only 400 copies extant, at the most)Having said this, and while I recommend this edition without reservation, it is not the most lavish or expensive edition ever printed. It does contain the definitive corrected text according to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun though the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun both publish editions which are much more expensive, and there are and have been numerous other leather (quarter to full-bound) and full-bound cloth, slipcased Proper_Noun cloth, leather), gilt-edged, illustrated or engraved (various), hubbed, deckled, and otherwise "deluxe" multi- and single-volume editions of Proper_Noun over the years.Still, with the possible exception of the British Proper_Noun 50th Proper_Noun edition Proper_Noun is a complete seperate book design Proper_Noun unique Proper_Noun covers, case, color scheme, exterior markings, type, etc.) I do think this is an elegant, beautiful book. The color, the choice of foil stamped images (and the stamping quality itself), the inclusion of Proper_Noun own artwork (and the particular choices there), the paper, type, ink, and other elements each and all combine to produce an outstanding book-object. I believe Proper_Noun would be most pleased with it, on its own merit and compared to all the other editions currently in print.
