130This story is by far one of my favorites. I read it several times a year, so you might be suprised that I am rating it with only 2 stars! The reason it received such a low rating from me is the binding of the book, and the poor quality of the printing would not last through one of my readings. I had to send it back. I have the paperback edition and have for years, and it has held up through a lot. I was looking for something to last even longer - this was not the right choice. I was expecting much more from the Proper_Noun edition, but I guess I should have learned not to place so much on the Proper_Noun hype. I DO recommend reading Proper_Noun it Proper_Noun change the way you daydream for years... but find a version that Proper_Noun last with those years, because you wil want to return to this story...
