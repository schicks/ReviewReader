1,034As someone else mentioned, we all know the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun to be by the far one of the greatest works of writing of the 20th century. It is all a game we play with Proper_Noun for he too took it much more seriously then any other Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writer ever has. He made up languages that existed in relationship to languages and dialects that we have in english, and thus created a nightmare for Proper_Noun He told stories of all sorts of perils of creation, and made sure everything was done right. Thus, when an edition like this comes out, it is truly painful. For one, originally, Proper_Noun created some of the most beautiful maps of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun spending time making sure that all of the proportions were accurate. He didn\'t just jumble down some lines for the coast line, for example. He spent many hours making sure everything was proportinate and made sense. However, sometime after 1988, Proper_Noun started to release editions of the triliogy with completely new maps, all signed by some Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In either case, these new maps were plauged with problems, from being too cartoony and unproportinate to having names of locations from the original maps done away with. The maps, from the very beginning, have been essential to the Proper_Noun books, and having cheap maps made is annoying beyond belief. It shows a sign of disrespect from the editors. To me, it says, "People won\'t notice anyway. Lets make a smaller sized book with less detailed maps and save some money." If you truly want to expierience this epic (or history, more accurately) as Proper_Noun envisioned it (not some editor at Proper_Noun spend some extra cash and either get a different edition or buy a good map (there is currently an excellent one made by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which is much larger and detailed). Of course, were the map adequate, this edition still suffers from annoying miscopies and misprints and so on. Don\'t sell out for cheap editions. You\'ve been warned.
