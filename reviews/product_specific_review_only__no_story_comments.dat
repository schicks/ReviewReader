Tolkien is my hero, and the reason I began writing in the first place.  I don\'t feel like I can write a review that will do him justice, nor do I think I need to - far wiser people than I have written reviews of the books themselves.  This is just a note for people who are thinking of buying this particular boxed set.The cover art is beautiful.  Fellowship is a panorama of Hobbiton.  The Two Towers is a picture of Gandalf and Saruman silhouetted in Orthanc.  The Return of the King is a group of riders, probably the Rohirrim.  Incidentally, in the back of RotK you get a sneak peek of Eowyn!  I was sorry when I first opened one that the map of Middle Earth wasn\'t in the front of the book...then I saw the huge fold-out map inside the back cover!This is the fourth LOTR boxed set my parents and I own between us (the 1968 version is falling apart, and the one I got for graduation got borrowed &amp; never returned) and I don\'t regret the money I spent on it.Indeed, my one regret about this set is that they didn\'t do The Hobbit to include.  They could easily have used a picture of Bilbo or the Lonely Mountain on the cover and issued a full set.  Still, there are some beautiful editions of The Hobbit out there and I\'ll pick one eventually to go with this lovely set.
