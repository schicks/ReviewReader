As there are already more than plenty of reviews to tell you about the story within, I will use my review to hopefully clear up some of the confusion related to what was thought to be printed (or misprinted) in certain editions of the boxed set - in particular, the Houghton-Mifflin edition with the Alan Lee cover art illustrations (ISBN 0618002251).FACT 1:  The sentence that reads, "The Breelanders locked their doors at night, which was also not unusual in the Shire," does not exist in the Houghton-Mifflin edition.  Or rather, the sentence that another reviewer quoted was a typographical error all on its own (aside from the word \'unusual\').The actual (and possibly revised) sentence reads (in the Houghton-Mifflin edition in The Fellowship of the Ring on page 97 in the Chapter of \'A Conspiracy Unmasked\'): "The BUCKLANDERS locked their doors at night, what was also not USUAL in the Shire."As I do not own the Ballantine version of the book that the other reviewer quoted from, I do not know if the quote was indeed a correct quote (in which both \'Breelanders\' and \'unusual\' were misprinted) or if the reviewer had meant to say \'Bucklanders\' instead of \'Breelanders\'.FACT 2:  The artwork contained in this boxed set was drawn by/provided by: Alan Lee (cover art illustrations), Steven Cooley (cover design), and... J.R.R. Tolkien (illustrations in The Hobbit) himself, Christopher Tolkien (Lord of the Rings) himself, and a Mr. Stephen Raw (which I will explain further).The Hobbit\'s illustrations - save for the jacket cover design and artwork - all reflect the same artwork as was done by Tolkien in the older hardback editions (30th, 1966) where the inside cover page said \'Illustrated by the Author\' as well. This also means that the map related to the story of The Hobbit is Tolkien\'s as well.For the Lord of the Rings, there is a note on the maps which says that Mr. Stephen Raw reproduced Christopher\'s original maps to be as close as possible, but reduced in size so they could fit into the paperback version.FACT 3:  The Houghton-Mifflin boxed set edition books all say, "The text of this edition of (insert book title here) contains all corrections and revisions that have been made since the original publication."FACT 4:  Douglas A. Anderson (with the guidance and supervision of Christopher Tolkien) oversaw the assembly of this boxed set edition and provided editorial notes related to various changes, revisions, additions, etc.FACT 5:  The text IS on the small side of things especially for the Lord of the Rings books.  The Hobbit - being a shorter book and possibly also being geared towards younger readers - has a larger size font for the text.FACT 6:  The books are easy to read (save for the smaller font size in the LotR books) and easy to handle as the books easily fall open and without damage or incident to the spines.FACT 7:  The books are packed tightly and fit neatly into their box.  There is nothing sloppy about the presentation.These main points made, I will say that in my opinion, the Houghton-Mifflin edition is a wonderful addition to anyone\'s reading collection... so long as the reader in question is interested in reading a most-current version of the story with all the revisions, corrections, and additions (post-3rd printing of 1966) more or less finalized.The revisions are current and up-to-date and Douglas Anderson not only explains the publication history of The Lord of the Rings (and The Hobbit) and its history of changes but also gives a list of references in his notations for those who wish to see what revisions, exactly, were made (and why).As these revisions were all supervised and approved by Christopher Tolkien, I cannot see why anyone would find reason to argue the validity of this particular edition of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.The Houghton-Mifflin boxed set is comprehensive and \'complete\' in both story and notations and appendices and the care that was taken in putting together this edition - paperback thought it is - is quite evident in the resulting product.Everything said, I am happy to own a copy of my own - both for looks and for reading.
