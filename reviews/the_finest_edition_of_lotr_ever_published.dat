While the price of this book is steep, this is easily the best version of this book in print.  The gilded pages and high-quality leather look, smell and feel wonderful.  This is not the questionable quality leather used on previous versions, this is the real deal.  More importantly, this version has, as J.R.R. recorded in letters, reproductions of the Book of Marzubul.  These are the pages from the Dwarven book found in the Mines of Moria by Gandalf and the Fellowship.  In the begining and ending of the book are also included maps that fold out to render Middle-earth for the reader, again as the author originally wanted.This is the book that Tolkien dreamed of having published but couldn\'t due to the realities of post-WWII publishing costs and questions about a 400,000 word publication.For me, there is an emtoional response to this book for two reasons.  One, it is as fine or better than the book the author originally wished to have published and two, it is a beautiful piece of art all on its own, suitable for display.  If you love books or love Tolkien or both, this is a must have and the centerpiece of any worthy collection.(Some are commenting that the book isn\'t actually leather. Be sure to check your version as there are others available, but the information provided to me stated my copy was leather and if it is fake, it fooled me.)
