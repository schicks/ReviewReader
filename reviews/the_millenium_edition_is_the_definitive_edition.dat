I found this \'Millenium\' version of the (now misnamed) \'Trilogy\' before I had heard about the coming movie.  Being a Tolkien fan, I immediatly snatched it up.  This is, by far, the best edition ever published.  From the plain black covers with the Eye of Sauron symbol, to the seperation into the original six volumes (plus index,) this edition is a must-have for Tolkien fans.This edition includes the SIX-volume series ("The Ring Sets Out" and "The Ring Goes South" making up what is normally called "Fellowship of the Ring", "The Treason at Isengard" and "The Ring Goes East" being "The Two Towers", and "The War of the Ring" and "The End of the Third Age" being "Return of the King") and a complete index.  I own the HarperCollins published British edition, which includes an amazing CD of Tolkien himself reading passages from the books before they were published.  (Including a haunting reading of the famous \'One Ring to rule them\' passage, as well as some passages that were changed before the first printing.)All in all, a must have.
