Perhaps you will not believe me when I tell you that I have listened to this recorded book upwards of twenty times, but I have! I love J.R.R. Tolkien\'s masterpiece, but when Rob adds his incredible powers of voice and rythem the book wraps you up in its spell. The voices he gives each character are distinct and lifelike; Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, and Aragorn are all portrayed to the life. Every character is so real you can almost see them.Rob Inglis sings each of the songs (which pack the books with life and color) with a nice, rich voice that does them justice. He makes the tense moments tense, the beautiful moments beautiful, and the tragic moments tragic (I still cry when Gandalf falls in Moria)...may seem alot to spend...but this audio book is worth EVERY penny. I know the books almost by heart now...
