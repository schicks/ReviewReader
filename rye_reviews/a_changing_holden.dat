Holden Caufield jumped into my life about seven years ago when I was in high-school.  I thought he was a funny smart alec who understood how rough it can be to be a teenager.  But the more times I read this novel the more I realize that, while Holden\'s sense of humor is funny and smart, his attitude on life is one of fierce detachment.  Through his relationship with his sister Pheobe, we can see that the only thing Holden truly loves is the past, and his only dream is to halt things where they are so that the things he loves will not change in any way.  He is still suffering from the loss of his brother, Allie, and can not stand it that someone so young and innocent could have departed so soon.  He is embittered against his brother D.B. who, Holden feels, has sold out in order to write scripts for Hollywood movies.  And he is fiercely protective of his sister Pheobe, the only thing in his life that is still fresh and innocent and the only person he truly loves.  Every anecdote and conversation that Holden has screams of this obvious longing to just stop things for a bit and not have to worry about people changing or growing up.  There is not a single character with whom he interacts with for more than five minutes that he doesn\'t wind up resenting due to some part of their personality which indicates to Holden that they have sold out, moved on, lost track and become phonies.  Outside of Pheobe there is only Jane Gallagher, the girl he used to hang out with, who he can view as being the same as she always was.  And although Holden mentions calling her up numerous times in the book, he never actually communicates with her in any way being too afraid of what he\'d find out about her.  Especially after learning at the beginning of the novel that Jane has gone out on a date with his roommate, a known ladies man.  The idea that Jane is now facing the trials and tribulations of real life would be too much for Holden to deal with, resulting in a strong desire to talk to Jane, but a fear of what he might find out.  Holden is left with the memory of Jane as he loved her, and the real life Pheobe who he still loves, but desperately wants to preserve, thus finding peace at the end of the novel as she rides around and around, hopefully for Holden, forever on the merry-go-round.  I related to Holden when I first read him.  But I find I relate to Salinger as an artist more then Holden after subsequent readings.
