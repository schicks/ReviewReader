Have you ever gotten fed up with the world?  Have you ever just had enough of everybody\'s stupid, phony attitudes and this tainted game that we call life?  You feel like you\'re all alone, there\'s no one that will listen to  you, and the ones that do turn out to be perverts and phonies.  Are they  all crazy, or is it me?This is the attitude that Holden Caulfield, a  disgruntled 16 year-old, takes toward life.  He\'s just flunked out of  another school, his younger brother Allie is dead, he\'s a virgin, and to  top it all off, everyone around him is a phony.  Holden is alone in this  superficial, corrupt world he lives in.What amazes me most about A  Catcher in the Rye is it\'s incredibly controversial beginnings when it was  first published.  The book took place and was published in the 1940\'s, and  society was based on being right and proper.  Things like hollow  conversation just for the sake of conversing defined what Holden held as  "phony".  Holden hated phonies with a passion, and throughout the book made  brutal, dead-on observations about the world which were stated in crude  dialect.  This caused much uprising in society, and was stereotyped as  "evil" and "insignificant" by the common "phony" book reviewer of the time.  Even serial killers were found with the book on them.  Mark Chapman, the  man who murdered John Lennon, was found with the book in his pocket after  the crime.  As you can imagine this didn\'t help the situation at all.In  the real world, evil was personified as Holden Caulfield.  People reacted  to the book just as people reacted to Holden in the novel.  Holden was  considered a rebellious, ungrateful, disrespectful teenager that, although  rare, is a worldwide epidemic.  But if you see past the narrow-minded view  that people tend to look through, the book is a testament that this  rebellious teenager is a person.  The book shows that Holden, although a  sarcastic, nasty, unlikable guy, is a person inside who is just trying to  save the virtue of innocence.Holden sees the world as perverted and  narrow, and has a nervous breakdown when he sees innocent children about to  fall of the cliff.  This cliff is a thought of Holden\'s of which he states  when asked what he wants to be when he grows up.  Holden says that he wants  to be a catcher in the rye.  He envisions children playing on a field of  rye, and next to this field there\'s a cliff.  Holden would catch the  children if they didn\'t look where they were going and accidentally ran off  the cliff.  There is incredible symbolism in this statement.  The children  represent childhood innocence and purity.  The cliff, or what lies below  it, represents the tainted, impure "game" of life, in which so many people  have fallen.  These people, the phonies, are what Holden despises most.  Holden demonstrates his desire to save innocence when he finds that  someone\'s written "f*** you" on a schoolhouse wall.  "I thought how Phoebe  and all the other little kids would see it, and how they\'d wonder what the  hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them- all  cockeyed, naturally- what it meant, and how they\'d all think about it and  maybe even worry about it for a couple of days."  Holden rubbed the mark  off, and felt extreme hatred toward the person who wrote it.Holden hated  everything.  Everything he held sacred turned out to be a disappointment.  A girl in which he thought was innocent and pure turned out to be "given  the time" by a suave roommate of his.  Another girl whom he dated was such  a phony it almost made him vomit.  He gets roughed up when a disgruntled  pimp comes around to collect more than Holden owed for a prostitute whom he  didn\'t even have sex with.  An old teacher that finally understood where  Holden was coming from turns out to be a pervert when he\'s found patting  Holden\'s head in the middle of the night.  Nothing sacred and nothing pure,  and the worse part was that Holden was, self-admittedly, too "yellow-belly"  to do anything about these things.  A boy lost in a sick world, helpless to  its evil, and yet Holden\'s the crazy one? Holden speaks the brutal truth,  and admires others who do.  For example, Holden said that he really admired  this kid, James, that Holden knew, who said that another kid, Phil, was a  conceited jerk.  Phil was much bigger, and he and six other jerks went into  scrawny James\' room and beat him up, wanting him to take back his comments.  James never took it back, but instead, decided to jump out a window to his  death.A key factor that made this book enjoyable was the style in which  its monologue was written.  This book is definitely not an English  teacher\'s dream when it comes to grammar, sentence structure, etc.  But the  dialect, risqu\xe9 even by today\'s standards, conveys a feeling of reality  that is not obtainable by any other literary device I know of.  Holden\'s  sarcasm, humorous attitude, and flat out bluntness had me laughing page  after page.  This line, chosen at random, demonstrates Holden\'s attitude  and dialect, "You should\'ve seen the way they said hello.  You\'d have  thought they hadn\'t seen each other in twenty years.  You\'d have thought  they\'d taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little  kids.  Old buddyroos.  It was nauseating.  The funny part was, they  probably met each other just once, at some phony party.  Finally, when they  were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced me."So why is A  Catcher in the Rye a great book?  I think what makes a great book great is  its ability to communicate with the reader.  Every teenager I know can  easily relate to Holden Caulfield\'s situation.  The book is a comfort if  you\'re a teen feeling the same things as Holden, criticizing the world and  its occupants.  Holden Caulfield is a hero that wasn\'t afraid to speak his  mind.  He taught me that your criticisms of the world are not invalid, and  that there is nothing that you can say that is so bad that you have to  repress it.  Holden made me feel a little less alone.  He made me feel like  there were others in this predicament that we call adolescence.
