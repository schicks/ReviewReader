As one of those `classics of literature\', it almost seems sacrilegious to criticize a critical success like `The Catcher in the Rye\'.  Well, I can\'t help but feel as though the novel\'s garnered respect and praise is a little much when you actually consider how little the novel really says about adolescence.  Sure, it tries (and at times succeeds) to convey a feeling of apathetic innocence, but its construction is rather off-putting and it\'s overall anticlimactic result is less ambiguously rewarding and more strangely hollow.`The Catcher in the Rye\' is an ambitious story that attempts to say a lot but fails to really live up to its potential.The novel tells of two mere days in the life of the recently expelled sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield.  Not wanting to face the wrath of his parents, Holden decides to avoid home for a few days (until he\'s expected back), living on his own in the city.  The premise is merely a foundation for Holden\'s simplistic views and reasoning\'s concerning life and his future.  He considers everyone around him to be fake and undeserving of his time, yet it is obvious that Holden is just as `phony\' as the rest of them.  He goes on dates, gets trashed at bars, sneaks off to visit his sister, imposes (or does he) on a former teacher and even has a run in with a pimp.Sadly, all of this is conveyed in Holden\'s uninteresting and at times aggravating delivery.I\'m not trying to lighten the point which J.D. Salinger was trying to make, for it is a very poignant (maybe even more so today then when the novel was actually written) point.  Our young ones are just as misplaced and confused as Holden, and so his tale of apathy masked desperation is one that we could all learn from; but Salinger loses my patience with his redundancy.  Some have complained of the same thing, which I was pleased to see (it proves that some people are willing to think outside of the preordained box).  Holden says the same thing on just about every page, so much so that the surprise is stripped from us and we are left with a predictable tale of teenage angst.  Maybe that was the point, to expose the lack of genuine life that resides inside someone of Holden\'s nature.  He thinks that he is the only `real\' person around yet it is obvious to all onlookers that he is basically walking death.  He is offering nothing, yet he `has\' potential; or so we are told.The story is crucial yet the delivery makes this a difficult read, one that you almost don\'t want to bother with.  I\'ve read novels that are hard to read due to their construction, yet they possess a certain otherworldliness that make then necessary (look at `A Clockwork Orange\' for just that), but `The Catcher in the Rye\' lacks the emotional connection needed to make it worth suffering through.  In the end the novels brilliant moments (like Holden\'s confession as to what it is he really wants to be) are masked by all of the mediocre (or just plain uninspiring) ones, leaving us with a novel that feels incomplete and a concept that deserved so much more than it got.And the ending, I just have this to say.  I am all for the anticlimactic; believe me.  I relish in the idea of a simple `stop\' put to a novel, for it allows the reader to move on with a sense of personalized closure.  I often think of Bret Easton Ellis, in particular `Less Than Zero\' when I think of that sort of ending; an open ended closing that leaves you deciding the fates of the characters yourself.  If often works beautifully, but here it seems rather empty as apposed to rich with meaning.I just kind of shrugged it off because I didn\'t really care what happened next.One might protest that that is the point, that we aren\'t supposed to care about Holden, thus furthering the poignancy of Salinger\'s point; but to them I have only this to say:  "YOU HAVE TO CARE FOR IT TO MATTER."  You cannot reach an audience if they are not moved.  If we adopt the same apathetic attitude of the main character then we simply have not achieved the desired response.  If this novel is to mean anything then we have to be stunned, mortified and moved to action because of it; and for that to happen it has to be delivered in a way that actually EFFECTS us.  For me, and apparently a few others, Salinger didn\'t do that.I know that I am in the minority here, but I have to speak my truth.
