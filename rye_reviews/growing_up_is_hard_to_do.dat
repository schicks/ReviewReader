In the 1950s America had just won The War and our economy was set to take off like a rocket.  A tall, white, wealthy male would be the apex of power and prestige in that world.  And yet we have a teenage Holden Caulfield who is depressed and disappointed by the phoniness and ugliness of his surroundings.  If nothing else this novel reminds us that even those at the pinnacle of privilege  have death and loss to deal with.  Being  sensitive and alienated can happen to anyone.But it seems Holden takes things too far by flunking out of every school he is sent to and by failing to actually connect with anyone.  Only his ten-year old sister is able to charm him out of his self-destructive moods.Holden is a teen who sees grace and  nobility in his younger sister, and in the memory of a younger brother who has recently died.  At the previous boarding schools, a tormented student fell to his death, while wearing Holden\'s borrowed sweater. It\'s a graphic depiction of the thing Holden seems to want to do--catch children who are falling over the precipice from childhood to adulthood and save them--and therefore himself, before it  is too late. Holden can\'t seem to find a worthwhile adult to emulate anywhere.The language and the storytelling in this novel are brilliant.  Old Caulfield is not really a phony.  He smoked and drank, stayed up all night and traveled alone in ways contemporary teens raised by helicopter parents could never imagine.  It was fun to hang out with him and try to understand.
