There are two types of readers, I believe, who tend to criticize this Salinger classic. The first is the frustrated student who finds it in their summer reading list and second, a pretentious reader that will criticize it for it\'s simplicity [naturally remarking that the book is overrated].This classic, which follows a day in the life of Holden Caulfield when he gets kicked out of yet another private school, is truly one of the foremost literary fictions ever written. First published nearly half a century ago, it\'s story is still relevant to every young generation that has followed since. Holden\'s anti-heroic personality manifests itself in popular film and literature even today [and often]. On the surface the story is simply about a clever, but volatile, teenager that can\'t seem to stay sane in his own skin; a coming of age story. But more than that, "Catcher" is a look through the eyes of a misfit, an individual gifted/cursed with a hightened sense of the world, who cannot rectify in himself how he could stand to be happy in this world he sees as corrupt and full of hypocrisy. And yet he desires to be accepted. For all liberalists, this is a story that will touch that part of you that has looked at the unjust world and wondered whether or not you, as an individual, fit into it. It is a critique of family, friends, teachers, and essentially, human flaw and the struggle to accept it, all seen from the eyes of Holden Caulfield, a young man who simply can\'t pretend he doesn\'t notice that things around him are wrong. But the brilliance of the book lies in the fact that the entire book begs the question, What is wrong with Holden Caulfield?
