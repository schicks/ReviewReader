This book is best read for the first time as a teenager, preferably as a book NOT assigned by school, because teens quickly grasp that Holden Caulfield is on to something about the adult world -- namely, that much of it is phony.  The allure to Salinger\'s classic, then, is in its contrary mood and anti-establishment tone.  Holden has little patience for most anybody and can pick up a phony on his "radar" from a mile away -- a gift many teenagers share when it comes to the adult world.Readers tend to fall into two camps regarding Holden.  One camp, the majority, holds him as an endearing rebel with a regrettable depression problem that grows as the novel unwinds.  The other camp, an admittedly sizable minority, holds him as an annoying whiner who complains about everything and gets nowhere in life (as you\'d expect).  Clearly Salinger intended readers to tune into the former, and if you embrace Holden in that spirit, you will personally gain something from his travels through New York and realize that, deep down beneath all his cynicism and sarcasm, Holden really does care -- too much, in fact -- and has a code he not only lives by but judges others by.While there are no end to the characters Holden criticizes, take note of those he respects as well.  Old Jane Gallagher with her kings in the back row (checkers).  The nuns at the sandwich bar.  The little girl with the loose ice skates.  Phoebe and Allie.  For readers feeling hostile to Holden (or to a teacher who has assigned this book and thus changed it by putting it under a microscope or assigning pop quizzes about it), I suggest going out of your way to look for these positives.  You\'ll see that Holden is incredibly sensitive and ethical, can be sentimental about others, cares about women and girls, and understands right from wrong.Read in that spirit, the book can\'t help but be viewed as a modern classic saying as much about the world as it does about teenagers.  If you\'ve ever caught yourself wondering about some really strange (and unique!) things like where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, then you\'ll identify with this lost soul in search of life\'s meanings.This is Salinger\'s best in my opinion.  I say that because it holds up to multiple re-readings, and any book that can offer new insights under such scrutiny MUST be doing something right...
