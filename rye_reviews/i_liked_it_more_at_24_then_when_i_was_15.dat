I first read this book when I was a sophomore in high school.  I remember myself drawn into it then but after I finished it I thought it was fun but didn\'t quite think it a classic.  Recently, I had felt a need to escape my everyday life and the idea of taking off from my job, roommates, life really appealed to me so I picked up this book again.  I read it little bits and pieces and treasured each moment.  I really identify with Holden a lot mre now after being in the world for a little bit.  Salinger\'s observations through Holden are interesting and his digressions make for great reads.  But what I noticed this time around almost above everything else is the intense and sharp humor of the book.  I found myself several times laughing out loud.  The book is really funny.  Holden\'s observations are so true, it\'s just funny.  The humor relies on behavior instead of jokes and I think at 24, I\'ve observed more behavior and appreciate the humor.  The relationships Holden has a very touching and interesting too.  I felt that he was more similar in this regard to an early twenty something than a high schooler, but I think early twenty-somethings are a lot more "phony" than holden so he works better as a high schooler.  It\'s a good book.  I want to read it again.
