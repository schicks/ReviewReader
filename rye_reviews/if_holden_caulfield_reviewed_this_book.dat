I just finished The Catcher in the Rye and sat down to write a review, and wondered what a review BY Holden Caulfield might look like. I mean, it\'s not a phony book. I hate phonies. They turn my stomach. I like to curl up in a chair with a good book. Why are people always saying that, I mean, what are we, cats? Have you ever seen anyone curl up in a chair or anywhere else? I gotta tell you I never have. I really haven\'t.This book, by J.D. Salinger, he captured exactly what I was thinking, it was kind of uncanny the way he did it. That\'s another thing I hate, the use of the word uncanny, I mean phonies use it all the time like it\'s some big deal. They really do.The best thing you can do is to read this book. It really is. It is the kind of book that you might not even like at first, sizing me up as a whiney little punk who could use a slap or two in the face to get me with the program. But the more you read, the more actual sympathy you feel towards me, or at least understanding of some kind, what I\'ve gone through, I mean. Where I am coming from in terms of how life is affecting me at my young age. And you see that I am quite tenderhearted after all. I really am. I end up feeling sorry for people, and I help them whenever I can. There is even a scene where I kind of get suckered into hiring a prostitute, it just kinda happens, and when it comes right down to it, I find what we are about to do actually degrading, and I no longer want to go through with it.I recommend this book highly. You will be missing out on insight into the mind of youth if you skip this book. You really will. And there\'s nothing I can\'t stand worse than someone who is too phony to even read about me.
