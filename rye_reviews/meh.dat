Yes, I am not ashamed to admit it - I hated this book. Why? It certainly is not because I was forced to read this for school - I actually read this book of my own volition because I\'d been hearing about what a classic it was, and I am an avid reader. So I pick it up and started reading it.I freaking hated Holden Caulfield. Now, I have read the other reviews on here (five-star) and dissertations on the deep meanings within the book and etc etc, so I listened with an open ear and mind on why people liked this book, and I respect that. I am not trashing anyone who liked this book, everyone has different tastes. But that doesn\'t cause me to hate Holden any less. I found his character utterly shallow and his adventures pointless especially since he got himself booted out of a private school, and this book a waste of paper, and that\'s how I feel about it.If you found this book to be awesome and learned something from it, then I\'m happy for you, and I\'m also glad that others could at least get something out of this book even if I didn\'t.
