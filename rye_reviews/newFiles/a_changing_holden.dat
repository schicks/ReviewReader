23Holden Proper_Noun jumped into my life about seven years ago when I was in high-school. I thought he was a funny smart alec who understood how rough it can be to be a teenager. But the more times I read this novel the more I realize that, while Proper_Noun sense of humor is funny and smart, his attitude on life is one of fierce detachment. Through his relationship with his sister Proper_Noun we can see that the only thing Proper_Noun truly loves is the past, and his only dream is to halt things where they are so that the things he loves will not change in any way. He is still suffering from the loss of his brother, Proper_Noun and can not stand it that someone so young and innocent could have departed so soon. He is embittered against his brother Proper_Noun who, Proper_Noun feels, has sold out in order to write scripts for Proper_Noun movies. And he is fiercely protective of his sister Proper_Noun the only thing in his life that is still fresh and innocent and the only person he truly loves. Every anecdote and conversation that Proper_Noun has screams of this obvious longing to just stop things for a bit and not have to worry about people changing or growing up. There is not a single character with whom he interacts with for more than five minutes that he doesn\'t wind up resenting due to some part of their personality which indicates to Proper_Noun that they have sold out, moved on, lost track and become phonies. Outside of Proper_Noun there is only Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the girl he used to hang out with, who he can view as being the same as she always was. And although Proper_Noun mentions calling her up numerous times in the book, he never actually communicates with her in any way being too afraid of what he\'d find out about her. Especially after learning at the beginning of the novel that Proper_Noun has gone out on a date with his roommate, a known ladies man. The idea that Proper_Noun is now facing the trials and tribulations of real life would be too much for Proper_Noun to deal with, resulting in a strong desire to talk to Proper_Noun but a fear of what he might find out. Proper_Noun is left with the memory of Proper_Noun as he loved her, and the real life Proper_Noun who he still loves, but desperately wants to preserve, thus finding peace at the end of the novel as she rides around and around, hopefully for Proper_Noun forever on the merry-go-round. I related to Proper_Noun when I first read him. But I find I relate to Proper_Noun as an artist more then Proper_Noun after subsequent readings.
