27While reading other reviews on this site, I find myself saddened by two problems people have with this book: 1) nothing exciting ever happens 2) Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is merely a cynical whiner In response to those who hold the first as a fault of the Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun perhaps you should learn a greater appreciation for literature and the human soul. In this age of shallow films and pulp Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fiction, people seem more concerned with cheap, "action-packed" thrills, and (not to sound like Proper_Noun or anything) it is depressing to see that people are unable to be moved by a book unless it involves a homicidal clown or a rebellious Soviet submarine. In response to those who feel that Proper_Noun is just a mindless cynic, I feel as if you have failed to see what lied beneath his very blunt Proper_Noun often true) observations of the numerous rituals that are plentiful in American society. After finishing the book, Proper_Noun did not seem to be a cynic, but rather a figure of both youthful desperation and enlightened sympathy. He was by no means just an ass for he saw beauty in such innocent things as his little sister\'s joy while riding a carousel and the strange excitement felt by a humble drummer as he prepares to play a few, almost meaningless notes, and reflecting upon such things, one is lead to the belief that Proper_Noun deep within his heart, wishes not to merely criticize but to help others by showing them the pointless suffering caused by their own arrogance Proper_Noun self-glorifying form of cynicism) and self-centered attitudes. Thus, it can be concluded that it is not Proper_Noun who is insane, but the world itself. Proper_Noun sees through their insanity, and criticizes the disease, not the diseased.
