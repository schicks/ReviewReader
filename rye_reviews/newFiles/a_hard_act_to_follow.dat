13"Catcher in the Proper_Noun portrayed the suffering and alienation of an otherwise privileged, middle-class young man long before such a theme became fashionable. So much of today\'s writing with comparable themes seems like a tepid imitation of the original.Holden Proper_Noun is an utterly convincing character who is not reaching out from the pages and trying to grab our sympathy. Salinger should be commended for not endowing Proper_Noun with bathos and excessive sadness. Instead, he presents Proper_Noun state of mind in a simple, lucid narrative. As a result, this novel is very effective in examining timeless questions about the nature of happiness and the conflict between the individual and society. There is also a compelling honesty in Proper_Noun writing that makes Proper_Noun so believable that I frequently forget he is a fictional character.This book should be read by young people and adults alike. It should also be read by aspiring writers attempting to market their own tales of woe.
