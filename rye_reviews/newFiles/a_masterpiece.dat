149I read Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun while on break from school. I\'d heard many allusions to the book, and many people said they liked it, yet I didn\'t really know what it was about. It is fascinating, a true inspiration. Proper_Noun is so complex that you can\'t stop thinking about him when you\'re not reading. Salinger\'s amazing insights into human nature and his clever style of cynicism is unique to much of literature and better than all contemporary literature. As Proper_Noun starts to spiral down, you can\'t help but feel incredibly sad thinking about his situation. A boy, on the brink of breakdown, speaking of things that make so much sense. It makes you wonder if he\'s the one going crazy or if it\'s the way society is that is truly crazy. I will always love this book and I plan on going over it again to underline all the lines that I adored. For the people giving bad reviews, and as Proper_Noun analyzed their comments, I must say that you missed the boat. I\'m sure that you are the people that Proper_Noun is making his social critiques on. No symbolism, a boring character that is whining? Come again? Salinger\'s phrasing of his words is simplistic, but his message is not. Read it again, try and be more perceptive, and think harder about what is really being said. There is enlightenment waiting for you.
