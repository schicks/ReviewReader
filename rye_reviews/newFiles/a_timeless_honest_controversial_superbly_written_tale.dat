86Have you ever gotten fed up with the world? Have you ever just had enough of everybody\'s stupid, phony attitudes and this tainted game that we call life? You feel like you\'re all alone, there\'s no one that will listen to you, and the ones that do turn out to be perverts and phonies. Are they all crazy, or is it me?This is the attitude that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a disgruntled 16 year-old, takes toward life. He\'s just flunked out of another school, his younger brother Proper_Noun is dead, he\'s a virgin, and to top it all off, everyone around him is a phony. Proper_Noun is alone in this superficial, corrupt world he lives in.What amazes me most about A Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is it\'s incredibly controversial beginnings when it was first published. The book took place and was published in the 1940\'s, and society was based on being right and proper. Things like hollow conversation just for the sake of conversing defined what Proper_Noun held as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun hated phonies with a passion, and throughout the book made brutal, dead-on observations about the world which were stated in crude dialect. This caused much uprising in society, and was stereotyped as "evil" and "insignificant" by the common Proper_Noun book reviewer of the time. Even serial killers were found with the book on them. Mark Proper_Noun the man who murdered Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was found with the book in his pocket after the crime. As you can imagine this didn\'t help the situation at all.In the real world, evil was personified as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun People reacted to the book just as people reacted to Proper_Noun in the novel. Proper_Noun was considered a rebellious, ungrateful, disrespectful teenager that, although rare, is a worldwide epidemic. But if you see past the narrow-minded view that people tend to look through, the book is a testament that this rebellious teenager is a person. The book shows that Proper_Noun although a sarcastic, nasty, unlikable guy, is a person inside who is just trying to save the virtue of innocence.Holden sees the world as perverted and narrow, and has a nervous breakdown when he sees innocent children about to fall of the cliff. This cliff is a thought of Proper_Noun of which he states when asked what he wants to be when he grows up. Proper_Noun says that he wants to be a Proper_Noun in the rye. He envisions children playing on a field of rye, and next to this field there\'s a cliff. Proper_Noun would catch the children if they didn\'t look where they were going and accidentally ran off the cliff. There is incredible symbolism in this statement. The children represent childhood innocence and purity. The cliff, or what lies below it, represents the tainted, impure "game" of life, in which so many people have fallen. These people, the phonies, are what Proper_Noun despises most. Proper_Noun demonstrates his desire to save innocence when he finds that someone\'s written Proper_Noun you" on a schoolhouse wall. "I thought how Proper_Noun and all the other little kids would see it, and how they\'d wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them- all cockeyed, naturally- what it meant, and how they\'d all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days." Proper_Noun rubbed the mark off, and felt extreme hatred toward the person who wrote it.Holden hated everything. Everything he held sacred turned out to be a disappointment. A girl in which he thought was innocent and pure turned out to be "given the time" by a suave roommate of his. Another girl whom he dated was such a phony it almost made him vomit. He gets roughed up when a disgruntled pimp comes around to collect more than Proper_Noun owed for a prostitute whom he didn\'t even have sex with. An old teacher that finally understood where Proper_Noun was coming from turns out to be a pervert when he\'s found patting Proper_Noun head in the middle of the night. Nothing sacred and nothing pure, and the worse part was that Proper_Noun was, self-admittedly, too "yellow-belly" to do anything about these things. A boy lost in a sick world, helpless to its evil, and yet Proper_Noun the crazy one? Proper_Noun speaks the brutal truth, and admires others who do. For example, Proper_Noun said that he really admired this kid, Proper_Noun that Proper_Noun knew, who said that another kid, Proper_Noun was a conceited jerk. Phil was much bigger, and he and six other jerks went into scrawny Proper_Noun room and beat him up, wanting him to take back his comments. James never took it back, but instead, decided to jump out a window to his death.A key factor that made this book enjoyable was the style in which its monologue was written. This book is definitely not an English teacher\'s dream when it comes to grammar, sentence structure, etc. But the dialect, risqu\xe9 even by today\'s standards, conveys a feeling of reality that is not obtainable by any other literary device I know of. Proper_Noun sarcasm, humorous attitude, and flat out bluntness had me laughing page after page. This line, chosen at random, demonstrates Proper_Noun attitude and dialect, Proper_Noun should\'ve seen the way they said hello. You\'d have thought they hadn\'t seen each other in twenty years. You\'d have thought they\'d taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced me."So why is A Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun a great book? I think what makes a great book great is its ability to communicate with the reader. Every teenager I know can easily relate to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun situation. The book is a comfort if you\'re a teen feeling the same things as Proper_Noun criticizing the world and its occupants. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a hero that wasn\'t afraid to speak his mind. He taught me that your criticisms of the world are not invalid, and that there is nothing that you can say that is so bad that you have to repress it. Proper_Noun made me feel a little less alone. He made me feel like there were others in this predicament that we call adolescence.
