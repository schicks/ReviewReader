3This is a book about nothing. And I loved it.Well, not strictly nothing. I guess it\u2019d be better to say that it isn\u2019t a book about anything in particular. Not anything except Proper_Noun Proper_Noun our teenaged protagonist, who spends quite a bit of time in his own head and not very much time actually going out and doing the things he thinks about. Proper_Noun pretty much IS the book. If you like him, you\u2019ll enjoy \u201cThe Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun but if you hate him, you\u2019re not going to have a very fun time.Fortunately, I liked him.Let me tell you a little bit about what Proper_Noun like. He attends a fancy prep school in Proper_Noun that he\u2019s just been kicked out of Proper_Noun he\u2019s a smart kid but not really up to things like doing his schoolwork or turning it in. Plus he\u2019s got a little brother who died of leukemia, a big brother who\u2019s off in Proper_Noun writing for film (much to Proper_Noun disgust), and a little sister who he loves to pieces. However, Proper_Noun doesn\u2019t have an equally strong relationship with his parents, so he decides to leave school a few days before his eviction date and hang out in his hometown, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a while. Anything\u2019s better than where he is, right?Not really. Proper_Noun thinks about calling up some girls he used to know. He thinks about hiring a prostitute, just to keep him company. He even thinks about going to live in the wilderness, because anything\u2019s better than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun school, of course). But guess how many of those things he does? You\u2019ll have to read the book for the exact answers, though. Some of them may surprise you.Here\u2019s what surprised me: liking Proper_Noun If you don\u2019t read this and think, Proper_Noun kid needs some help,\u201d you might need a little help yourself. But even psychologically messed-up people can be good and kind, and Proper_Noun got more than a little kindness in him. You can see it in the little sister he adores (I happen to be a huge sucker for guys who love their little sisters, or their mothers, or even their dogs). You can see it in the way he wants to punch the heck out of anyone who tries to mess with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun And you can even see it in the way he talks to people he meets on the street Proper_Noun well, some of them. Like I said, the guy needs help. A lot of it.But then again, so do most teenagers, whether it\u2019s Proper_Noun kind of help or something a little more subtle. And really, anyone who recognizes that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are in lust, not love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun does) is a lot better off than a lot of so-called \u201cnormal\u201d people anyway.
