2I am so late to this book, that it\'s embarrassing. I\'m 59 years old and just read it for the first time last week. Somehow, no one had ever told me that I HAD to read this book. That\'s the only reason I can think of as to how I missed it.But, what a joy it was to find this at any age. You don\'t have to be a teenager to identify with Proper_Noun as long as you\'ve been one at one time!The one thing Proper_Noun like to add, after reading the first couple hundred reviews here, is, I think his brother\'s death had a lot more impact on him than people mention.I love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I hope he had a good life.
