15I\'ve never even come close to reading this classic by Proper_Noun Salinger until I picked up this cheap little copy a few days ago. My only knowledge of the book came from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the killing of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun two decades ago. I sat down with it right away and quickly became engrossed in the story told by narrator and main character Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It\'s absolutely incredible that this was written in 1951. The language is slangy and fresh enough to make anyone believe that it was written close to today.The book is an account of a few days in the life of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun teenager and cynic. Proper_Noun gets kicked out of his prep school and wanders around Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a few days, trying to avoid his parents and having a few interesting encounters along the way. All of these events are related to use directly through Proper_Noun worldview. This worldview is depressingly downbeat, as Proper_Noun views most who tramp through this world as "phonies". To use one of Proper_Noun favorite phrases, what "killed me" about this book is Proper_Noun ability to transform extremely arcane sensations and emotions into prose. When Proper_Noun talks about his dead brother Proper_Noun he mentions how red his hair was. To show the reader how red it was, Proper_Noun talks about a day he was golfing and turned around and saw Proper_Noun about 150 yards away watching him. Great imagery! I could actually see his red hair while I was reading this. I loved Proper_Noun hunting cap, the imagery of his being the catcher in the rye, and the ducks and frozen fish in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun All point at Proper_Noun as something deeper than an angst-addled teenager slumming through Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is on a quest to save kids from his own fate. He achieves this in a sense at the end with his kid sister Proper_Noun thirty years old, which is still young enough to understand how Proper_Noun feels. I went through a stage where I felt exactly like Proper_Noun Everybody does to some extent, I think. The trick is to survive it and not let it destroy you. I really thought this book would end on a bad note, but it seemed uplifting in a way. Read this book, if for nothing else then to say you\'ve read it. Once you get started on this one, you will have a tough time putting it down. Recommended.
