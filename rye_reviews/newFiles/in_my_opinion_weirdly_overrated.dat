2I have read tons of comments and references to this work, and about Proper_Noun for so many years, I decided to get a copy of this book, and to be honest, I am very disappointed. I have read that teens and older people have been greatly influenced by this work and the protagonist to the point of committing violence based on alienation depicted. I have mulled this over for a couple of weeks since I read the book and still don\'t Proper_Noun it". In my opinion, there is only enough content in this writing to make a decent short story, which would still not rank near something by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or a dozen or more others. Maybe Proper_Noun just too old "and all", but I can remember my teen years, and I think that if I read this book then, I would not have been able to finish it because it was about such a profoundly stupid guy, privileged but brain-dead. I think the only thing that keeps a reader\'s attention is trying to get to the end and see if anything redeems the time spent getting that far. I wanted to like it, because Proper_Noun a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and affect anything Proper_Noun but...I have continued to think about this book, and why it is so unsatisfactory to me. It\'s because it\'s written as a monologue by the protagonist/narrator, who is presented as the child of an upper-middle-class Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun family, but his vocabulary is not in character. To my ears, it sounds like he was written to sound like he did not, could not or would not use the language of his peers. Maybe we are to assume he is mentally retarded, or in modern parlance "intellectually challenged". Since the other characters he interacts with read as normal, that may be the answer to my complaint.Whatever the answer, Proper_Noun sorry I read the book. Then I could continue to think it and its author were special and excellent, instead of being disappointed.
