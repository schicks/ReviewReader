90I had to struggle to give that one star. Salinger is, perhaps one of the most overrated authors Proper_Noun ever read. The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is THE most dull, boring, cringe-worthy books Proper_Noun ever had to force myself to read. Proper_Noun rather be locked into a school room with dozens of students raking their nails against a chalkboard hours upon hours. How this book could inspire someone to murder anyone is beyond me. The only person I wanted to murder was Proper_Noun Salinger for the hours of my life I will never get back! Honestly, Proper_Noun rather die than read this book again. Pure torture &amp; a massive waste of time.
