865 million copies in print since 1951 and we are still divided into one of two camps. We either glorify Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as a teen sounding the anthem of rebellion for generations of our youth or we vilify his disregard for normalcy along with his x-rated coming of age and attempt to shield our children from the stark reality of the real world. 65 million copies in print yet it still holds records as the most censored text in American history. It\'s an enigma. I will not attempt to understand the irony of such numbers or dissect what many believe to be the perfect novel, alongside one or two others, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of particular note. Legions of academics have come before and attempted to pull forth the inner meaning of the scenes in his dorm, the stories of his friends and family, in particular the death of his brother and relationship with his younger sister. Even more poignant would be the potential deflowering of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the girl next door, which seems perilously close to the first published incidence of date rape, for which Proper_Noun gets a bloody mouth trying to rise in her defense, but for which Proper_Noun Salinger, never takes the opportunity to investigate fully. What a missed opportunity for what would surely be a fantastic prescience of a modern scourge.Beyond Salinger\'s description of what it might like to be "Down and Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun ala Proper_Noun we never quite arrive. When Proper_Noun paints the seedy underbelly of Proper_Noun in, "On the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun can\'t quite go those places, after all he\'s only 16. And beyond Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Scott\'s descent into alcoholism, in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun we don\'t see much change from being on the streets in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a generation later. The streets are still no less unforgiving of character.In modern times, perhaps Proper_Noun Proper_Noun comes the closest to being on the street, as a teenager, but for him it\'s in Proper_Noun and with him "After Proper_Noun touches something that Proper_Noun has brilliantly described, but has left unnamed. Proper_Noun doesn\'t shy away from depression and suicide. Proper_Noun ran through the door, yet left it all unnamed. I haven\'t done a comprehensive search for other\'s of the 65 million readers who think that Proper_Noun accurately depicts teenage depression, but to me, this is his real genius. Without a doubt, Proper_Noun had first hand experience with depression, whether it\'s his own or someone close to him...what he has brought to us, since most schools seem to include it as required reading, should be the open conversation we have with our kids about depression. This should be the conversation from Proper_Noun not one of being rebellious or being sexual or homosexual or dropping Proper_Noun of school or having a plan for our lives or the sage advice of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Depression should be our first stop, those other topics, are heavily treated elsewhere in modern society. Depression and in particular teenage depression still remains stigmatized and taboo.I\'m going to give this book 5-Stars and society\'s reaction to the book 2.5-Stars (50/50 for those who worship it and those who censor it) even if for the wrong reasons. I\'m also going to give my teenage daughter 5-Stars for forcing me to read it, so she could talk to me about it\'s deeper meaning--a meaning that she has referred to as beautiful. But just to clarify, the beauty for her is contained in the message that a "Catcher" is someone trying to ward off the corruption of innocence as we come of age...not my introduction of depression into the greater conversation...but that conversation will happen as well. In the end a catcher could well be defined as someone who combats the cliff of teenage depression and the scourge of teenage suicide as well as delaying the end of innocence...intentional or not. For me, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun hit the ball Proper_Noun of the park on the subject of depression, and that was over 60 years ago.
