3There is a literary critic named Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who wrote two superb books on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun can find them\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B0043M5RPY">here</a>\xa0and\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/here/dp/B00AMM5OB6">here</a>\xa0). In the introduction to the first book, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun tells a story: when he was young he loved the writing of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but, when he got to graduate school, he began to read more "sophisticated" writers - or writers who were deemed more sophisticated by the academy - authors like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun still cherished Proper_Noun but he began to look down on him to some degree as less sophisticated or as less of an artist. Proper_Noun wound up rereading Proper_Noun later in life, rediscovered his artistry, and he wrote two books analyzing Proper_Noun craft - and I think they are two of the best books of literary criticism I have ever read (and I have never liked Proper_Noun all that much).I had a similar experience with The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun I read it as a teenager and I loved it. I then read it again in my early twenties and I still loved it. For a long time I would have considered it my favorite work of fiction. Then I went to school for philosophy and I also began to read "more sophisticated" writers like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I still held a special place in my heart for The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun but I also felt as if I had outgrown it to some degree. I think that is the image that a lot of people have of this book: that it is a book for angsty teenagers and, once you are past that stage, it no longer has the same impact. I think that is totally wrong - I think this book has as much substance as any work of fiction ever written - and, strangely enough, it was Proper_Noun Proper_Noun himself who convinced me of that.I was browsing through a volume of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lectures\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Faulkner-in-the-University/dp/0813916127">Faulkner in the Proper_Noun I noticed that Proper_Noun was mentioned in the index, and I found this quote, Proper_Noun have Proper_Noun read all the work of this present generation of writing...So I must speak only of the ones I do know. I am thinking now of what I rate the best one: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun perhaps because this one expresses so completely what I have tried to say: a youth...must someday be a man, more intelligent than some and more sensitive than most, who...because God perhaps had put it there, loved man and wished to be a part of mankind, humanity, who tried to join the human race and failed. To me, his tragedy was Proper_Noun that he was, as he perhaps thought, Proper_Noun tough enough or brave enough or deserving enough to be accepted into humanity. His tragedy was that when he attempted to enter the human race, there was no human race there" Proper_Noun speaking about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun said Proper_Noun story was an intelligent, very sensitive young man who was - in this day and time was an anachronism, was almost an obsolescence, trying to cope with a struggle with the present-day world which he was Proper_Noun fitted for, when he didn\'t want money, he didn\'t want position, anything, he just wanted to find man and wanted something to love and he couldn\'t. There was nothing there. The nearest he came to it was his sister who was a child and though she tried to love him she couldn\'t understand his problem" (246-247). I think Proper_Noun comments on the book are quite insightful - they completely contradict all the negative reviews of this book that label Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a "spoiled brat", etc. - and they convinced me to reread the book and, far from finding that I had "outgrown" it, I found that many of its profoundest and most beautiful aspects had escaped me in my first two readings. I would like to share some of them.The story is obviously about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is obviously a depressed and lonely teenager. Many people who read the book feel Proper_Noun loneliness is a result of a kind of misanthropy - he hates people, he finds them all "phony", and he cannot stand to be around them. This is why, I think, some people seem to have such a negative reaction to the book and wind up dismissing Proper_Noun as just a spoiled brat. I am Proper_Noun a developmental psychologist but, at least in popular consciousness, we all seem to believe that teenagers go through a phase where they hate everyone and think they are smarter than everyone. This book is often dismissed as being nothing other than an expression of that attitude, but I think that is a total misreading of the book. People who read the book in that way never stop to ask "What is it that Proper_Noun "hates" about humanity?"Well, Proper_Noun hates "phoniness". But what does he mean by phoniness and why does he hate it? He hates that, in all of his social interactions, people are always putting on airs, trying to impress. What Proper_Noun craves is some kind of genuine human interaction, something beyond showing off. He is looking for the genuinely human which is why I think what Proper_Noun has to say about the novel is spot on. He loves that his old girlfriend Proper_Noun used to refuse to move the kings in the back row when she played checkers. The fact that Proper_Noun refused to move her kings is something that makes her unique, but no one else seems to care about it or find it interesting. For Proper_Noun other people\'s values are misaligned: people are impressed by someone who is strong, excels at academics, can throw a touchdown pass, but they ignore and find no value in our shared humanity, in our shared weaknesses and idiosyncrasies. Stradlater does Proper_Noun care that Proper_Noun does Proper_Noun move the kings in the back row, he just wants to sleep with her, and in order to do so he plays a game, puts on a facade, etc. It does Proper_Noun matter to him that there is no genuine connection as long as he gets what he wants.That is what Proper_Noun hates, and it is why he gets in a fight with Proper_Noun Far from being a sign of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for humanity" it is a sign of his "love for humanity". He loves all the things about people that everyone else finds worthless. He loves their eccentricities, their vulnerabilities, their weakness. He does Proper_Noun care about all the things that people like to brag about. He cares about what makes us human and unique. The reason he is disgusted by humanity is because he cannot find anyone else in the world who values those things. Society destroys the weak. He tells a story about a fellow student in his speech class The student was a nervous, shy type, but when he would go off on tangents about his uncle he would get excited and animated - he was talking about what he loved. Rather than encourage that, the students were taught to yell Proper_Noun whenever the speaker went off topic. The process of socializing a human being into a productive member of society - someone who stays on topic - is deemed more important than encouraging an individual\'s unique humanity. That is what Proper_Noun finds disgusting.All through the book, Proper_Noun is desperately trying to find some genuine connection with someone, to have a social interaction that is Proper_Noun based purely on trying to impress or outdo one another - and he fails. He attempts to express his despair, but no one is capable of reading the subtext of what he is saying - it all just leads to more misunderstanding. He is talking with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and he starts to form all these plans about running away to the wilderness with her. The subtext of what he is saying is, Proper_Noun am miserable! I need to get away from this suffocating atmosphere!" but Proper_Noun does Proper_Noun hear any of that. All she can think of are all the practical problems with Proper_Noun plan. Instead of trying to comfort him or telling him things will be okay - which is what he really needs to hear - she starts to poke holes in Proper_Noun plan, which only increases his despair. The book is full of poignant and beautiful moments - glimpses of our shared humanity, which is usually hidden behind the masks that we put on. Proper_Noun is like someone searching for a flower in an industrial wasteland and, whenever he thinks he sees one, someone comes along and stomps on it out of carelessness, or rips it up by its roots, or simply ignores it. This book is Proper_Noun a denunciation of humanity - it is a cry for humanity, and a very moving (and funny) one.
