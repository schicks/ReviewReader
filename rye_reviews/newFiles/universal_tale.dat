343I\'ve read The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun many times--when I was 11, 13, 15, and 17 years old. Seriously. I loved it from the first time I read it, but it didn\'t hit home until I was a junior and senior in high school. I AM Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Well, not literally and exactly. But almost. Holden is an extraordinary character. His absolute terror of leaving the wonderful, innocent, carefree world of youth is something everyone can relate to. Proper_Noun about to graduate from high school, and even though Proper_Noun excited to be a free, independent adult, I can\'t help but be terrified of the corruption and hard reality that lays ahead, which I have been blind to, as a young person. I mean--who wouldn\'t miss being a kid?--living at home for free, not having to do anything or be responsible for yourself or anyone. Holden embodies this. To me, that\'s what I related to most from the book. Most kids I know don\'t like the book cuz they\'re forced to read it for class, which is understandable. I wish they could see the beauty, and heartbreaking universality of Proper_Noun story, though. It is something Proper_Noun Salinger had the talent to grasp, and share it with the rest of the world.And it\'s so freakin\' inspirational I have to go on Proper_Noun and tell some people!
