3The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun was a very bizarre read. I caught that the main idea was to convey the hardships experienced by most adolescent boys when coming of age, but I found nothing more significant than that. I kept searching for a more important lesson but all I found were complaints about "phonies" and eccentric anecdotes describing the tough life of a semi-rebellious teen. The writing style was choppy, erratic, and simple to convey that the ideas are coming from Proper_Noun juvenile mind, but rather than entertain me, the style Proper_Noun constant Proper_Noun annoyed me. The book is considered a classic, but I don\'t see any reason why it should be. It\'s a bizarre and simple story written in an obnoxious way with no underlying important theme other than the already obvious.
