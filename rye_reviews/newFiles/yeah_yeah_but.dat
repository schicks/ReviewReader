155I know this book is "it", and there is a lot of blather from ecstatic readers about universal coming of age and a rueful sadness at loss of innocence. Okay, fine. It\'s in there. I laughed a couple or three times, and I even recall a good belly laugh. Good. And obviously there is Proper_Noun gift for spoken language and keen insightfulness regarding social peccadilloes and irritating manners. Most folks can identify with Proper_Noun exasperation and frustration toward those who adapt to and adopt those "socializing" manners and peccadilloes as they transition to adulthood. Proper_Noun seeks to resist that polluting influence, which is admirable, right?Only, there\'s a problem. In spite of his recognition of the problem(s) in others, he is part of the problem himself. He candidly admits that he has a variety of personality quirks and negative behavioral characteristics. But he also has irksome and annoying behaviors that he doesn\'t recognize, and so his conduct contributes to the same noisome and spoilsome social corruption that he laments in others.This book has a tremendous fan base. It is beloved as a cultural and literary artifact. It is also praised for its dialog and characterization, and rightly so. The story is skillfully presented, no doubt. Superlatives are tossed about Proper_Noun the terms "genius", "master", and "brilliant" in the gushing spotlight review dated Proper_Noun 21,2000) when this novel is discussed. I understand why this is so, but I find myself tending to agree in sentiment with the tone of the one-star review below by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This book is over-hyped. While Proper_Noun character may ring true in both voice and observation, the result is a confection that is light in substance. Proper_Noun is a study in sweet angst, yes. So?The theme of the book isn\'t related to the word picture captured in the title, contrary to the regurgitated observations made below. The theme is that humans are broken, and while they may be able to see what is wrong, they aren\'t much capable to do anything about it. Even if they can act to resolve a problem here or there, they are instigating and engendering their own set of problems elsewhere.The musician Proper_Noun authored the popular song "Every Proper_Noun You Take" while a member of the band the Proper_Noun He has voiced his consternation at the way the public responded to his song, which was #1 on the music charts for some time. Proper_Noun points out that the song is not about sweet, devoted love at all, but is rather about an obsessed and ugly jealousy that is controlling and disturbed. The public was happily and haplessly ignorant of this, naively not picking up the clues in the song or the video, even though the high-key, low-fill lighting used in the video gives a classic noire, deep-shadow depiction of a character with a dark side. Proper_Noun has often confessed his exasperation with the public\'s inability to recognize the song for what it is, and he finds the song\'s great popularity as a wedding song shocking and shallow.The same is true of The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun As the other spotlight review by Proper_Noun from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun illustrates, readers typically tend to identify with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Jack\'s statement is sterling: I AM Proper_Noun Proper_Noun "The number of readers who have been able to identify with Proper_Noun and make him their hero is truly staggering," claims the Proper_Noun website. The ironic fact is that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is one of the most pathetic and self-deluded characters in Proper_Noun fiction. He is, in his own wrecked way, as much a phony as any of the other characters upon whom he appends that label. Proper_Noun is everything he despises, despite his limited recognition of his own failings. For any reader to make the choice to happily identify with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is to embrace in oneself the personification of foolishness. It is nothing less than gleefully claiming to be a phony. Look again at that Proper_Noun quote above, then go figure.My two-star rating is probably more a function of my reaction to the story\'s popularity, a la Proper_Noun than my reaction to the humor and craft of the story itself. I would probably give the story three or four stars (3\xbd maybe?) based on those qualities. I would be willing to give the story five stars for it\'s superlative depiction of the inability of humans to recognize their own shortcomings while they so easily dwell on the failures of others, except for one thing: the evidence suggests that Proper_Noun failed in making his point. In a tremendous irony, one perhaps not unexpected, readers on the whole appear to be incapable of recognizing the true theme and purpose of the story. It seems that hardly anyone learns from the novel, they just Proper_Noun it. Reviewer Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in his 5-star review below, even mourns that he wasn\'t quite as cynical when he was a teen as Proper_Noun manages to be in the story. How utterly bizarre!Yes, people are Proper_Noun Proper_Noun what a sad, pathetic, shameful, and repulsive situation that is. Proper_Noun proved a truth rather than exposed it--that is a failing--and the book loses any luster it might have been able to sustain because of that monumental shortcoming.
