This book is extremely overrated. While I appreciate Salinger\'s writing style, the story itself is pointless. Holden Caufield whines for 200-odd pages. This is somehow supposed to be relevant or edgy, but really it is  just boring. The reader is given no reason to like or care about Caufield  or his story. Why people gush over this book is beyond me. All Salinger has  done is to paint a stereotype of a weak, callous, angry young man. I feel  sorry for anyone who says they "relate" to this book, because it  is clearly a condemnation on Salinger\'s part of youth in general, which I  believe is unfair.
