I had to struggle to give that one star. Salinger is, perhaps one of the most overrated authors I\'ve ever read. The Catcher in the Rye is THE most dull, boring, cringe-worthy books I\'ve ever had to force myself to read. I\'d rather be locked into a school room with dozens of students raking their nails against a chalkboard hours upon hours. How this book could inspire someone to murder anyone is beyond me. The only person I wanted to murder was J.D. Salinger for the hours of my life I will never get back!  Honestly, I\'d rather die than read this book again. Pure torture &amp; a massive waste of time.
