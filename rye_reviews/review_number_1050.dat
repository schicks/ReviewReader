Any book that elicits this much of a response is certainly powerful.  Is it a good book?This IS a good book.  Why?  Holden is one of the most believable characters ever written.  He sees that adults are  "phony," and he doesn\'t want to be one of them.  Who can blame  him?  He is sometimes whiny, but I think he knows it and the sincerity of  his pain is absolutley devastating.  He is immature, but he is fighting  against the loss of his innocence.  He\'s a very perceptive, if not always  very articulate, sixteen year old.If you never had any doubts about  the truthfulness of the way adults represent themselves, or if you think  prose should always be lyrical, you might not like this book.  If you are  interested in an honest representation of a youth\'s struggle with his  impending adulthood, you probably will.Either way, you should read The  Catcher in the Rye, just so you will know what everyone else is talking  about.
