C\'mon, does this book really need a review? It\'s "The Catcher in the Rye," it\'s Holden Caulfield and it has captivated readers for decades. Whenever I begin to lose faith in the world, I reread this story and Holden\'s sweet sadness revives my spirit. Yes, we\'re still plagued with the kind of "phonies" that drive him literally crazy, but rambling through New York City with this lovable young curmudgeon is still my favorite antidote. I see rainbows in those gas puddles, too, Holden. Thanks for teaching me about little miracles like that...
