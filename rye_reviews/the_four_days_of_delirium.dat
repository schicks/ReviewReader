The Catcher in The Rye is about a young adolescent male named Holden Caulfield who loses his grip of reality.  The theme of catcher in the rye is Holden wanting to be a catcher of children to save them from growing up to adulthood.  He has not been able to make  the transition himself.  This is shown by his constant finding fault with  everything (the phonies) but he then justifies the phonies to make them  acceptable to fit into his life.  He is constantly disappointed with people  and things which creates a state of anger and frustration. For him things  and people are either totally right or totally wrong. He can\'t find the  balance of reality.  Holden begins the story as a young man who is  dealing with just being kicked out of Prep School. He is trying to deal  with the reaction to how he feels how his parents are going to react and of  the perception of others on him as well. His encounters with Mr. Spencer,  Ackley and his roommate Stradlater present Holden finding fault with  everything (the phonies) . Nothing is good enough for him.  His ramblings  on throughout the book is a dialogue to the reader (or therapist)  demonstrating his inability to organize his thoughts in a logical and  reality base. Just as he finds distaste for many things and people, he in  turn justifies the events or people as to make them not so bad.  His  self-deception creates a false perception thus producing his distorted view  of his reality.  Holden leaves the stability of the prep school to  go to New York City for many experiences that would be more typical for an  adult than what a young boy of his age would normally experience. He sees  himself as an adult capable of drinking, having sex and just being  self-sufficient. He also thinks of himself as being better than others as  in his relationship to his experiences with the nuns.  He wants to  experience the luxuries of adulthood but not the responsibilities.  In  the latter part of the novel, Holden is sick physically, because of lack of  sleep and proper nutrition, as well as, mentally sick. His thought  constantly returned to his sister and his perception of protecting her.  He  doesn\'t want to have things change as in his reaction to the items in the  museum. They stay the same. The scene where Phoebe is on the merry go round  Holden finally stops assigning absolute values to things and finally breaks  emotionally. He cries releasing his tears of delirium The book Catcher in  the Rye has many themes and underlying ideas but one basis of confusion.  Holden sees adulthood as a cliff to fall off, instead of a mountain to  climb. His pessimistic perception of the world is what really does him in.  He is his own worst enemy.  If Holden could only realize it is possible to  commit no mistakes and still lose...this is not a failure, just life.
