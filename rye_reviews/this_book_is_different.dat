I have been reading many of the reviews on this page, some critical, some positive, and I have condensed the opinions to the following.  Those who don\'t like the book seem to think that the book is disconnected, swears too frequently, or has no plot.  Now, I realize that some negative reviewers have differing opinions, and I respect them, because the book is different from most literature, classic or otherwise.Most literature describes an event, using the characters to interact with their surroundings.  There is a defined plot, there is a defined theme, the people do normal things, and everybody who reads it gets pretty much the same thing from it.  For an example, I\'ll quickly examine a well-known piece of literature, "A Christmas Carol" by Dickens.  I am not going to go into great detail, I am not an expert on this work, but when I say "A Christmas Carol" you see ghosts, kids with canes, and London.  If asked "what is it about" you might say, "the redemption of Scrooge" okay great.  Everyone agrees, discussion ended."The Catcher in the Rye" is not like that.  People with literal minds hate books like this, because everyone who reads it, takes something different from it.  These people say, "nothing happens, the symbolism was great, but there was no plot".  To them I say, "Who cares?".  I want to meet the person who declared that every book needs clearly defined plot, theme and grammar, to be good.  Writing is about more than following the proper steps.  A monkey can be taught to follow steps, a third grade student can learn to fill in blanks.  Writing is about communicating.  Some critics look at a work of Dickens and say, "Now, there\'s a good book, that\'s how writing is to be done.  All the concepts are well thought out, the grammar is letter-perfect, and the word choice is outstanding!"  And that is great for them, I\'m excited that they feel this way, now we know that there is yet another job that a computer can be taught to do, critique literature based on grammar, punctuation and spelling.  These rules are rules we give our elementary students so they can be understood when they write.  If you want to buy a book, so you can examine grammar and word usage, don\'t buy this one.  Salinger didn\'t sit down to write a book for his college English professor.  If you want to look at his work from that standpoint, then it would be an awful book.Fortunately for the human race, writing is not about that at all.  Writing is not only about being understood, writing is about feeling, writing is about telling another human being, what an experience is like.  This is what Salinger has done.  He has captured the teenage experience, the anger, the frustration, the disappointment, the feeling of hopelessness, the paranoia, and the feeling of looking out at society and realizing that it\'s not a nice place to be.  Salinger did not write about the idea teenager, if he did, Holden would\'ve sounded like a member of the Brady Bunch  "The world is a happy place".  Often, people like to rationalize what happened in this book, by saying, "Holden is sick, he is unusual, nobody else goes through this" this is not the case.  True, Holden did move to California, apparently to seek some type of counseling, but he is far from unusual, he is truthful to himself, he is telling about the world the way it is, not the way he wants it to be.In the book, Salinger is communicating to two types of people.  On one hand he is telling the people whose lives have been like Holden\'s that someone understands them.  Someone else has been though what you\'ve been through, it\'s a normal thing. And he is telling the Brady Bunch people "WAKE UP!  Take off your rosy colored glasses, the world is NOT one big happy place, at least not for everyone.  Yes, somewhere in the distance, there is war and hunger, but there is something more, and it\'s right next to you.  There are people who can\'t find the most basic human need, the need to be loved and accepted."  Holden feels lost and alone, he feels like nobody cares about him, he feels rejected by his family, and he feels hopeless because he everyone and everything he knows either lets him down, or lies to him.  This is real life, this is what it\'s like to have everything not go your way.  If you are looking for fairy tale or soap opera, this is the wrong book.  You also shouldn\'t read this book if you are going to use a holier-than-thou attitude and judge everything that is wrong.  To read this book, you need to be realistic, and empathetic.  This book is about the bad side of life, it can sometimes be hard to follow, and you may reach the end and wonder what happens next.  Read it a few times in that case, you may learn that this kind of writing is not about what happens next, it\'s about what already happened, and most importantly; why?
