NOTE:  I will give a very mild rundown of the book but wont give details.  SO you can read my review and still read book.  I won\'t "Spoil" it for you, lol and wont tell you in order the events take place.What can you say about the #1 banned book in public school libraries and maybe even libraries period.  You can say this---even after all these years, it still sells millions of copies all over the world.  Rather than ban the book, and pretend life is not difficult sometimes, I think schools should read and discuss, and maybe talk about ways various things could be handled, how to get help, who to turn to, etc.  In a nutshell, the reason its banned isn\'t because of language, sex, drugs, rock and roll, its banned because its about a teen age boy who is expelled from school (numerous times) and doesn\'t seem to like anyone or anything.  He is very critical and very disillusioned with life and how "phony" people become.  He leaves the school a few days early and its Christmas time in NY so its cold.  He left impulsively and doesn\'t know what or where to go.  He goes to a teacher he liked and who he trusts only to find a strange  situation that scares him so he leaves.  goes to a hotel and has a hooker come to room, and he realizes he is afraid of (he is a virgin) sex, and decides he just wants to talk.  She is angry about the time he is taking, (she has customers waiting) so he pays her the  agreed upon money and she is angry and sends her pimp up to get more.  Calls an old girlfriend, but that doesn\'t work out too well, so He goes home and sneaks in the house (mom and dad cannot know he is home because they will wonder WHY==and sees his sister.  She knows immediately and says "dad will kill you", (figuratively not literally) and they come home, so he hides and then sneaks out.  He is so negative about life, but he loves his family and he has dreams for the future.  Some are unrealistic, but he dreams.  The title came from a song he heard children singing and the answer to a question a date asked him after she said you don\'t like anything and want to be nothing , and he said yes I do, so she said, "name one thing" so he expalins.  You have to read for yourself.
