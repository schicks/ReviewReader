I don\'t really care if you like this review or not. Not going to try anything phony to persuade you one way or the other, and all that. Just really loved this book. I really did. People who gave it 1 lousy star are probably a bunch of phonies so who cares what they think. They\'re probably doing something phony right now, morons. Anybody seen my hat? Anyway, If you want to read a good book this one will do. If not.....then you can go pound sand for all I care. The thought of not reading this book is making me feel depressed, It really is. I think I\'ll read it again just in case a bunch of stupid morons decide not to. Let me know if you come across my hat.
