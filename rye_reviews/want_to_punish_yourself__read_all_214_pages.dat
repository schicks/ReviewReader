I am 54 years old and avoided reading this book for over forty years.  So why did I relent?First, because my 15 year old had to read it in Lit class, and I wanted to have something to talk with him about.  He hated it.  Really, he did.  My wife hated it too.  That killed me.  So I really HAD to read it now.Back in the 60\'s and 70\'s lots of conceited literati phonies kept saying how *Catcher in the Rye* was "The Great American Novel", "Salinger\'s literary triumph" and other such baloney.  They said that.  Really, they did.I ignored my *39-page rule* for two reasons----1.  if my son actually had to had to read the whole thing so did I; and --2. I thought after 39 pages Salinger would turn it around.  But no, he didn\'t.  He really didn\'t.  If you want to know the truth about it, I found *Catcher in the Rye*, wasn\'t all that those phonies cracked it up to be.I slogged through to the bitter end, all the while suffering as that conceited b-stard Holden Caulfield incessantly whined and complained about everyone and everything in the world.  It depressed the hell out of me, it really did.  The little rich boy should have been complaining about his laziness, absence of character, or inability to see the world and others beyond the range of his annoying petulant whine.It depressed me even more reading old Holden\'s monologue, spouting the word `g-ddam\' practically every 25 words.  (That got old VERY quickly.)  And at the end of the book, around page 200, he drags out the dreaded `F\' word.  That must\'ve made quite a stir back in 1945.Maybe *Catcher in the Rye* doesn\'t travel so well anymore because it\'s the 21st Century and all.  The world is so much bigger now, and somebody saying `g-ddam\' every other sentence isn\'t so unique and different.  Actually, it\'s rather tame for these times. Really, it is.Legend has it that after writing a few novels and getting so much attention for this book, old J. D. Salinger kind of disappeared.  He dropped off the face of the earth.  Really, he did.  Maybe I\'d kinda `disappear\' too if I wrote a book this dreadful and then it got all kinds of acclaim from those same phony literati scum-suckers that so disgusted my protagonist
