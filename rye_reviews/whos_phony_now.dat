A new generation of angry young men were inspired by J.D. Salinger\'s "Catcher in the Rye," a dark-edged little novel about teen disaffection. Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind -- those who want their teens clean-cut and meek need not apply. Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn\'t care less -- after all, it\'s full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide. Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably. Remember the disaffected anti-hero of "Igby Goes Down," who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Cynical oddball Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. "Catcher in the Rye" catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic. Most classics don\'t include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger\'s style for "Catcher" is an unusual one. Through Holden\'s eyes, it\'s a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden\'s own "phoniness," since it\'s obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It\'s subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite. Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don\'t really need to. This is Holden\'s story.Salinger\'s cynical tour de force "Catcher in the Rye" is a bitter pill to swallow, but it\'s definitely worth it. Disaffected, yearning and wry, this is a modern classic. And deserves to be, as well.
