Thirteen-year-old Harry Potter knows he can\'t use magic during his summer vacation.  But try as he might, he accidentally blows up horrid Aunt Marge like a giant balloon.  Instead of being expelled from Hogwarts, he is met by the Ministry of Magic himself and allowed to stay at an inn for the rest of the summer holiday.The reason becomes clear right before the fall term starts.  Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban.  He is a dangerous wizard who once killed thirteen innocent people with one spell.  Worse, he worked for Voldemort.  And everyone thinks he is headed toward Hogwarts to attack Harry.As if this weren\'t enough, Harry has his regular school work to do.  There\'s a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, one who actually seems popular this year.  Professor Snape is as mean and vindictive as ever.  Harry\'s new class, Divination, starts with the dire prediction that one of the students will leave and never return.  And Hermione has a schedule that is impossibly full.But as the year wears on, it becomes alarmingly clear that Harry isn\'t safe within the walls of the school.  Will Sirius Black be caught or will he get to Harry first?This is now the third Harry Potter book, and each one gets a little stronger.  I have finally accepted that the books are as much about his school life as the mystery, but the mystery is being set up earlier and earlier in the books.  The characters have been well established by this point, so the jokes between them immediately resonate with the reader.  Yet a new comer could jump in here and understand the majority of the story.I can certainly see why these books are so popular.  They are entertaining escapist fantasy.  I\'m looking forward to sinking into book four.
