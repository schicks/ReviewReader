The Harry Potter series has rapidly become famous for being fun, engrossing, and still fairly easy to read.  Prisoner of Azkaban is no exception to that at all.  While trying to avoid spoiling the story for anyone, there are a few things I\'d like to mention.  For one, I find this story a nice demonstration that Harry Potter is both starting to grow up and gain some independence (in this book he actively escapes his hated relatives, rather than being rescued by an outside force) and also still longing for a place in the world where he fits and is loved (this is especially played out in the links this story draws back to Harry\'s parents).  Also, on the whole, the characters offered in this book are admirable examples.  The new hero characters introduced turn out to be loving, loyal, and strong enough to survive even the worst circumstances.  One of the messages in this particular volume that I found pleasing was that the easy way out isn\'t necessarily the way to go.  That loyalty and love and a sense of what\'s right are what you should hold on to, even though that may not make it quite so easy to live comfortably (or even to survive).  These books are truly gems for readers of any age.  They shouldn\'t at all be dismissed by those at an adult reading level, as the stories are enchanting without being written at a level that will push your limits.  Yes, that makes them a poor choice for exercising those mental reading muscles, but it also makes them a good choice for a relaxing and enjoyable read.
