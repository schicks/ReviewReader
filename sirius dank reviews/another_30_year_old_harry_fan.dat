My hubby gave me this book for Christmas as I enjoyed the other two so much.  I can\'t really add much to what the other reviewers said, but I can tell you that the conclusion of the book is so exciting that I was up till  midnight finishing it (and I\'m usually a 10 o\'clock turn-in!).  I just  couldn\'t put it down.Harry, Ron and Hermione\'s exploits in this book  were just as entertaining - if not more so - as in the previous two books.It never ceases to amaze me the depth of Ms. Rowlings imagination!  The  different kinds of sweets, all of the different types of spells and magical  creatures...just delightful!Wonderful...just wonderful!
