Two things that J.K. Rowling has said in the past have caused me great suspicion:1) Deathly Hallows is her favorite Potter book;2) She\'s had the ending in mind from the beginning.In this final installment of the beloved Harry Potter series, Rowling vindicates herself in both assertions and wraps up the series in with a grand, wiz-bang wizarding finish. This IS the best Potter book (which makes me think I need to rewrite at least one of my previous Potter reviews); and it\'s now clear how details both small and large in the earlier novels were planted to set up the revelations in "Hallows". It\'s almost beside the point, what with everything being written in the surrounding reviews here, but I won\'t be the one to release any spoilers so soon after the book\'s release--except to say just this: When J.K. Rowling gave her pre-release body count (as she has done for each book going back to "Goblet"), she let out a number that was substantially short. In other words, hold on to your pointy hats, boys and girls, because a lot more than two characters exit this book in a box ...I hope there aren\'t too many Potterphiles out there who are set on traditional Rowling story construction, because she departs her usual linear track in this book just as soon as Harry leaves the Dursley\'s. To be fair, she more than hinted at this departure from form with Harry\'s stated plans at the end of "Prince", so there\'s no point in complaining about it. Indeed, there is such a total lack of predictability in this book, it makes me think I should have been a little harder on earlier books for being too "safe". I was, to use the cliche, holding my breath through the whole read (including after the power went out last night, when I read the climax by flashlight and candle).Rowling does the reader the ultimately courtesy, too, by wrapping up every loose end--not all very neatly or nicely, but wrapped up all the same. And then, when she\'s done that, she attaches an epilogue that should have all but the most stiff-necked of muggle readers smiling.I hope that this book is received with universal praise, and that it reigns in the last of the few readers who haven\'t yet come to Potterland (and I know you\'re still out there, all twenty-six of you blibbering, slope-foreheaded lobotomy survivors). Now that it is all over, you\'ll be reading with a key advantage: not having to wait one or two years between each book.Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for Harry, for Hogwarts, and for a contemporary classic that is certain to endure.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book, "Teeth: a Horror Fantasy".)
