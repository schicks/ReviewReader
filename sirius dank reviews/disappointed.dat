(**I tried to leave any spoilers out, but read at your own risk.**)I was aware that when I sat down to read the last Harry Potter that I felt a nearly physical sense of discomfort. The books have been becoming increasingly difficult to read, the world in them darker and more claustrophobic.For the moment, let\'s consider Harry. He was isolated, neglected and often abused by his foster parents. Even this book makes reference to the fact that he had known what it was like to be hungry in their care. His parents were killed when he was an infant, and he had no grounds on which to build security or trust.Then came Hogwarts. The initial few books were kind of great-- Harry finds a home. There was certainly danger there as well, but danger is kind of a minor price to pay for friends and surrogate family members. The books at that phase are delightful because of the way that they create a structure and a routine around a magical education. By setting the book at a wizadry boarding school, Rowlings makes it all new enough for it to be as delightful for the readers as it clearly is for Harry. It\'s fun to read about Quiddich and demerits and the sorting hat and all that jazz.But for Harry, the center does not hold. The violence and chaos increases, interfering with the structure and the routine of Hogwarts. By the time of this, the final book, it is no longer the site of anything like a normal life-- only the scene of the last battle against the dark. The adults who had hovered so protectively over the younger Harry are shown to be as weak or weaker than the students themselves. Indeed, those who try to protect him are victimized or killed-- making Harry responsible for the people who should be responsible for him.It\'s an uncomfortable thing. A child\'s worst nightmare. And also, a really powerful metaphor for adult readers. The YA fantasy turns slowly into something much darker. Something that implies that you can be born to sorrow through no fault of your own, but simply through any of the million unpleasant possible combinations of malice and happenstance.It was a brilliant turn in the series, actually.So where does that leave us with The Deathly Hallows?Eh.Like the Horcruxes, the Deathly Hallows themselves (...) are one of those ideas that tastes like too much icing on a very big cake. So never mind that. Red herrings, and not particularly interesting red herrings.A lot has been said about the death count. I won\'t spoil and discuss who dies, but only say that the deaths are mostly thrown away. They mean nothing, and affect nothing. It seems that she is just making the point that people can die.Mostly, I was disappointed with the ending. It felt fake, a pretty serious cop out. Rowlings could have done something really interesting. She had an opportunity to write something that was in line with Harry\'s arc as the dark hero. Instead, she went with comforting-- as comforting (and as easy) as she could possibly write.I know that HP is not aimed at me, one of her older readers. I don\'t even have a good answer how she could have worked something more realistic into a children\'s book. I look to Lord of the Rings as an example of how a satisfying resolution can still have a tinge of sadness that honors what the characters have been through. This book lacked that satisfaction for me.Too bad.
