I checked out the Harry Potter books out of curiosity when I heard that even adults were said to love them. I was hooked after the first one and the three Potter books have been the best, most relaxing, and fun reading I\'ve done in a long time. If a high-schooler can appreciate Harry Potter,  anyone can.  I do think, however, that "magic" should be  discussed with child readers so that they have a realistic perspective on  the world around them. The occult scene in our world is nowhere near as  benign as the environment at Hogwarts and children enamored with the  magical realm in Harry Potter need to understand that.
