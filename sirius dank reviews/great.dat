This book is for people of ALL ages!  It\'s amazing how you can create such an imaginative, creative book that is appropriate for everyone- from ages 5-up!  Once I got the first one I couldn\'t drop it...I finished it in 2  days!  I\'ve never read such a wonderful book! I advise you to read this  book, it catches anyone\'s imagination, full of love, determination,  courage, and friendship! Thank-you J.K Rowling for this exciting,  adventurous book!
