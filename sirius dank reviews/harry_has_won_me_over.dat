I\'m 25 years old, and in less than a week I have become enchanted with Harry Potter.  A good friend at work introduced the series to me, and I laughingly told her that I would give it a try.  Now I\'ve finished the  third in the series and am waiting for her to catch up to me!  I can\'t wait  for the fourth book to be released!  J. K. Rowling has a most special  talent in creating such vivid and enchanting novels.  No wonder readers of  all ages anxiously await her fourth book!  These stories will awaken your  imagination and take you on some wonderful and amazing trips!  I can\'t wait  for "Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament" due out this  summer!  :)
