This is the most INCREDIBLE book I have ever read-I reccomend it for ages 9-60! This book is better than the first 2 books put together. It is personally my favorite out of the Harry Potter series. If you dont get this book there is something wrong with you because I just read it and the way  the author puts this whole story together is amazing. I am begging you to  get this book. It sounds kind of childish when you first look at it but  just read the first book and you will see what I mean. This is the third  book in the series and the BEST!
