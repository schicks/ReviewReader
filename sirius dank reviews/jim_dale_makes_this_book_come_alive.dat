I have been a firm believer since book one that the best way to enjoy Harry Potter is to listen to it on audiobooks.  Wow does Jim Dale do an amazing job - again!  How he is able to do the voices of over a hundred characters and make them each distinguishable, I do not know.  The audiobooks sucks you in from the very first chapter.  I feel like I\'m there with the characters in the books listening in on private conversations.  If you\'re going to live the Harry Potter experience, I highly recommend going with the audio books.
