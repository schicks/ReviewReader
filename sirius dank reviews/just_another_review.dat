This book is a brilliant piece of literature. It\'s filled with insight and delight. Undoubtedly the best Harry Potter book (as of now because the new one\'s coming in a few months). Harry Potter is the next big name in  children literature. He\'s already world famous and it\'s been only a short  while since he first debuted two books ago. JK Rowling\'s ability to create  truly human characters is astounding. This book\'s characters are truly  human. I think that if you want to read a book with rich feeling and  emotion sprinkled with touches of childhood nostalgia and fantasy, this is  definately the series for you. It\'s a true delight to be able to realize  that such writing is still possible. The longest Harry Potter book to date,  this is my favorite. However, don\'t shun the first two. Each is a delight  onto itself. They\'re filled with suspense and adventure. I physically  laughed at the funny parts and shuddered with the fearful parts. I think  the best parts have to be the quidditch matches. I can actually feel myself  getting anxious as I read them. If you buy the first two, you\'ll discover  that little almost insignificant facts are explained by JK Rowling. The  fact that she connects everything makes me wonder just how much brilliance  she has. She\'s stuck easter eggs in every book to be explained later in the  series. These are the books to buy. If you\'ve been saving your money to buy  a book, Harry Potter is the series that you want to buy. This book will  awake the child in you if you\'re five or fifty. It\'s worth the cover price.
