Having been a fan of the books since 1999, I was anxiously awaiting this final chapter. However, I was left disappointed. It is by no means a bad book, but simply not everything I hoped it would and could be.***Spoilers Ahead***Spoilers Ahead***Spoilers Ahead***Spoilers Ahead***Rowling has been trying to tie up all the threads of the preceding books since a rather long and awkward passage of exposition in books 5 and 6, and it does little more than slow down the books. In this book we get loads of expository reasoning that tries to pull together disparate plot elements. It merely serves to halt the action and bore the average reader. Rowling is at her best when she is writing dynamic action scenes, producing fantastical settings or creating interesting characters. Too late in the book she introduces the concept of the Deathly Hallows and tries to join it to the plot of the Horcruxes. It seems forced and unnecessary. The Horcrux invention from the last book was quite enough of a plot to carry the reader through this final installment. The Deathly Hallows lend nothing to the story, and Rowling does little with it in the plot. There is no satisfactory explanation as to the Gaunt ring being a Hallow and a Horcrux and why Voldemort would not have known it was. And frankly, I didn\'t care. I was waiting for the final showdown between him and Harry anyway. Why introduce the whole robbing Dumbledore\'s grave for a wand plot? It went nowhere and just held things up a bit more.Another major problem in the book, as has been noted with previous books, is Harry himself. I was willing to put up with his uselessness in past books due to his age, but by this time I expected him to step up and prove himself. Instead, we get more petulance, whining and dithering. Hermione is smarter than he is, Ron, Ginny and Neville are braver, and Harry has to rely on outside help from a variety of sources (deus ex machina like Fawkes from book 2, his Invisibility Cloak in every book, and even Snape in this book) to achieve his goals. It\'s either this, dumb luck or coincidence that helps him locate the Horcruxes, seldom perseverance or intelligence. The final battle with Voldemort finds him again relatively passive, relying on his mother\'s protective charm and another coincidence to help him defeat Voldemort. Mrs. Weasley proves far more engaging in her face-off with Bellatrix. By page 450 I actively disliked Harry, which is a major problem since he\'s supposed to be the hero. He does redeem himself a bit in the later chapters, but it would have been far better if he had displayed more strength and intelligence earlier in the book.I also didn\'t like the Lord of the Rings plot rip-off with the trio of friends taking turns carrying the one Horcrux around their necks even though it affects their moods. Again, no satisfactory explanation is given as to why it can\'t simply be carried harmlessly in a pocket or bag. If this was Rowling\'s idea of homage, it missed the mark. Further, I could have easily lived without the character assassination of Dumbledore. Was it really necessary, and again, where did it lead?Having said this, there were a lot of good, well written scenes in the book, especially the Gringott\'s infiltration, and the final battle at Hogwarts. The book simply needed to be pared down to a reasonable length by a good editor who could keep the plot moving forward without clunky pauses to overexplain an overplotted narrative. As to the violence and dark tone of the book which some readers object to, I had no problem with it. It fit perfectly with where the story has been headed since the end of Goblet of Fire, and was to be expected. It would have been an unrealistic expectation to think that Voldemort could be defeated without losses on both sides. Overall then, a decent read, just a disappointing conclusion to a great book series. 3 1/2 stars out of 5
