This conclusion to one of the most culturally-significant literary works of our time unfortunately adds a thin layer of tarnish to the monument built by its predecessors.  It succeeds in all the important ways: it wraps up the story of an ambitious seven-part fantasy series with the predictable ultimate triumph of good over evil while letting its world live on as something greater than what existed on paper.  Rowling\'s writing style, while suffering a bit in this installment compared to the earlier books, is still tremendously humorous and entertaining in the right places.  And yet the book misses so many opportunities, takes so few risks, that it can\'t help but fall far short of greatness.In a way, I can\'t help but feel Rowling, knowing where she left off after Book 6 and where she needed to get to by the end of Book 7, had a shopping list of items to be included that dictated much of the flow of the story, rather than letting events run to their natural conclusions.  A sort of "I need this many people to die" and "These people must survive" and "These characters must be redeemed" list that left so many of the deaths and redemptions ring hollow.  Furthermore, the Potter books have always been rife with conveniences enabling Harry and his friends to succeed against seemingly impossible odds, and yet Rowling typically succeeded in veiling these in a way that the reader could assert that it was the heroes\' qualities: bravery, friendship, intelligence, etc., that enabled them to make use of these conveniences.  In Hallows, however, Rowling is seemingly unapologetic in providing events, items, coincidences, and "world lore/mechanics" that serve little purpose but to help her heroes win.The final chapters leave so much promised in the earlier books unfulfilled.  Important thematic elements and social commentary such as the relationship between muggles and muggle-born wizards and wizards, between wizards and non-human magical creatures, the social cost of a government completely undermined by what amounted to racism and classism, and much more were left hanging in the breeze.  To be sure, it is supposed that because the good guys won everything worked out for the better for everyone, and yet with a world stage and material to work with Rowling declines to take the risk of writing the more mature social and political commentary she had already laid the groundwork for, instead leaving the readers to resolve those threads in whatever way they chose in their own minds.  One can\'t blame her--why risk turning a part of her audience against her when her legacy was already secure?  Yet the ultimate unwillingness to take her story beyond the simplistic heroes vs. villain prevents the series from transcending the realm of well-written children\'s fiction with worldwide popularity to something more important and profound.A final note must be made about the epilogue, though it merely echoes what many have already written.  It is the worst piece of fanfic-quality trash ever committed to paper, a bone thrown to "shippers" that pales even in comparison to the coarse writings of the same.  Its presence and quality alone might say something about how Rowling and her editors approached this book, but such concerns have been voiced often, and loudly, before.The Harry Potter series has taken a rightful place among the greatest works of children\'s literature and the most culturally-significant literature of our time due to its widespread appeal and popularity, and the final book in the series serves as an adequate conclusion that will leave most readers satisfied, at the least.  Yet it had the potential to be something better than it was, and as a fan of the series that disappointment will always be there.
