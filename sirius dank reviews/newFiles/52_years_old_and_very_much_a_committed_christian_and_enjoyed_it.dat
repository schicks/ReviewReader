6I read the first batch of reviews (posted on amazon) before the book came in the mail, and wonder now that Proper_Noun read it, if we read the same book. There was the "you\'re all going to Proper_Noun for reading this book" which made me shake my head and wonder what team the writer is playing for, and then some negative stuff: Proper_Noun nudity in the book" Proper_Noun "Herminone is reduced to a crying girl who does Proper_Noun laundry (Hermione is the same decent compassionate level-headed character who saves the impulsive boys again and again), Proper_Noun doesn\'t even do anything; its just luck." (Umm, have you read the other books at all? That would be the pattern for our everyman hero.), "Ginny\'s just a tramp in this book." (Maybe with a lot of extrapolation in one scene, not key.) I enjoyed this book. For the last third, I couldn\'t put it down. I started reading these books when my then 14 year old got the 3rd and read it in a day and a half. Impressed, I asked to borrow it, and she insisted I start with the beginning. The whole family have since become Proper_Noun fans. Lot\'s of fun.
