11Having recently decided to read all of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels, finally, after years of seeing the films and hearing good things about them (Stephen Proper_Noun whose opinion on these matter I respect a great deal, raves about them), I must say: they are classic storytelling, destined to survive through the ages. I am not a part of Proper_Noun target audience (I\'m in my thirties), but as many have already said, it doesn\'t matter: Proper_Noun tale of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is no less involving or entertaining for those Proper_Noun can vote and drink booze legally than for those Proper_Noun cannot. Even though, in this novel, Proper_Noun finally reveals the time-frame of the story\'s events (just check out Proper_Noun parents\' tombstones, then do the math), it barely matters; though certain details only make sense in a post-industrial society, these are minor details. This is a story that I truly believe will still be treasured by readers of all ages for many generations to come, passed down along with the rest of our cultural heritage, and the future is better off for it.As for the particulars of \'Deathly Proper_Noun perhaps this isn\'t really a book for kids of a single-digit age. They should grow into it, as Proper_Noun first-generation audience has already done. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels have been gradually increasing in maturity, complexity, severity of the situation and exploration of profound themes from day one, and \'Deathly Proper_Noun brings a remarkable climax to all of these: fear of death, the temptations of power, the quiet yet awesome power of love, et cetera. It keeps you turning pages almost frantically throughout, manitaining suspense masterfully all the way and provides one of the most satisfying endings Proper_Noun ever experienced in a great novel. What more could one want? I\'m not going to talk about the particulars; suffice it to say that, both my near-fifty year old roommate, Proper_Noun read it first and was near-bursting to discuss it, and myself, having avoided all internet and news coverage after the day of release until I finished it, were completely fixated upon it as we read. We did little else, only eating, sleeping and watching very little Proper_Noun while we were reading it; he read it between the evening of Proper_Noun 23/7 and Proper_Noun 26/7 and I picked it up when he was done, finishing around 3.30 AM on Proper_Noun 28/7. And speaking as a couple of hyper-literate old occultists, people Proper_Noun read an average of at least three books a week, I feel I can say for both of us: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was one of the finest, most memorable fantastic/fictional experiences either of us have had in a long time. And regarding a particular character, one whose nature and fate was quite up in the air for most of the series, we were both delighted to have our dearest hopes proven right.There has been much debate as to whether or not the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels will, in the long run, increase the literacy of the generation Proper_Noun has grown up with them; they certainly won\'t hurt. With any luck, they will not only do that, but will also encourage their young readers to take on courage, self-reliance, wisdom and fellowship as virtues, and will perhaps cause them to value love and honourable conduct more than power and glamour. We can always hope. . .And as for those of you young folks Proper_Noun have been encouraged by these novels to read more, may I recommend the work of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is another great seven-novel fantasy series; it\'s quite different, but still awesome, and it ties in with many of his other books in a variety of interesting ways. When you discover Proper_Noun you discover a whole universe of great characters and crazy situations, albeit one very obviously created by an Proper_Noun If it\'s the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun world that appeals to you, perhaps you ought to look into novels like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun amongst others, or some of the novels of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of course, there\'s always The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun and its prequel, The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun really ought to be read first); you can\'t go wrong there. And later on, perhaps, when you\'re farther into adulthood, you might look into Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or her Lives of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun both of these series immerse the reader into incredibly lush, beautifully realised worlds- too bad their creator has been sucked back into the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and is now working to improve upon its old fiction. . .And for you adults Proper_Noun still haven\'t picked up the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels, thinking them \'children\'s books,\' get over it! They are no such thing; all of them are wonderful stories, and they lead to a grand conclusion, one to survive the ages. All in all, \'Deathly Proper_Noun is a truly classic ending to a tale that was remarkable and well-told right from the start. But don\'t cheat, you fellow grown-ups; make the time in your busy lives and start at the beginning!
