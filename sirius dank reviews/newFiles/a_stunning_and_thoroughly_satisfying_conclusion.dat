1,044This is arguably the most "hyped" book in history, and if Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had to sneak down to the kitchen for a glass of red wine to calm her nerves while writing The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun she said she did), one wonders what assuaged her while writing Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The collective breath of tens of millions of readers has been held for two years...and now...was it worth the wait? Did Proper_Noun Proper_Noun live up to the hype? (For that, amongst hundreds of questions, is really the only question that matters.)The answer, most assuredly, is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is told in a strikingly different style than the previous six books - even different from The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and, I daresay, it\'s a better written, better edited, tighter narrative. And while the action is lively and well paced throughout, Proper_Noun found a way to answer most of our questions while introducing new and complex ideas. What fascinated me was this: Some people were right, with regard to Proper_Noun is good, Proper_Noun is bad, Proper_Noun will live, Proper_Noun will die - but almost nobody got the Proper_Noun part correct. I truthfully expected an exciting but rather predictable ending, but instead was thrown for a loop. We\'ve known that Proper_Noun is fiendishly clever for years - but I didn\'t think she was *this* clever.Not since turning the final page of The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun twenty-eight years ago have I felt such a keen sense of loss. My love affair Proper_Noun everyone\'s love affair, I imagine) with all things Proper_Noun began somewhere in the first three chapters of The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and has lasted, on this side of the Proper_Noun three months shy of nine years. For all that time we have waited and wondered - was Proper_Noun right to trust Proper_Noun Will Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun get together? What\'s to become of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun What really happened on that tower, when Proper_Noun was blasted backwards, that "blast" atypical of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun curse as we\'ve seen it when used throughout the series. So many more questions than those listed here, and so many devilishly well-hidden hints. The answers, as I hinted above, will shock and awe you.When first we met Proper_Noun Proper_Noun he was "The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun with an address of "The Proper_Noun Under the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun could help but bleed sympathy for Proper_Noun treated abysmally - abused, really - by the only Proper_Noun relatives he had, and forced to live under said stairs by those awful Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun It was a sensationally brilliant introduction, one that ensured that our heartstrings would be plucked and enchanted to sing. He was The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun reading that first book, we have enjoyed Proper_Noun spry sense of humor - portraits that spoke, stairways that moved at any given moment, Proper_Noun jinxing Proper_Noun so that a pigs tail grew from his behind, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun fantastic creations, etc, etc., etc., and more etc\'s. There was a sense of wonder and magic in Proper_Noun writing, so thoroughly captivating that the recommended age group of 9-12 in no way resembled the book\'s actual audience. It was common to see adults walking about with hardcover copies of the latest book, sans dust jacket (to hide the fact that they were reading a "kids" book, I suppose). It was also common to hear of eight year olds sitting down with a seven-hundred-plus page book! By themselves! If I hadn\'t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn\'t have believed it.As for Proper_Noun we admired him. He wasn\'t afraid to stand up for what he felt was right, even if he found himself in detention for it. He was brutally honest, and immensely courageous and loyal. Proper_Noun came to embody, at times, Proper_Noun we would like to be. He wasn\'t perfect, of course. He suspected Proper_Noun of being the one Proper_Noun was after the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and in The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun he thought that Proper_Noun was the heir of Proper_Noun This didn\'t diminish Proper_Noun in our eyes - it made him more human, more real, and even, perhaps, more enviable.Endless fan sites have been erected. For an adult to go to any of them, and find that thirteen year olds are having an easier time parsing out the books plots, subplots, and mysteries, was (for me at least) humbling, but yet also a testament to Proper_Noun herself, and her remarkable creation. She encouraged an entire generation of young readers to read and to think for themselves.But the time has come to say good-bye, for this is truly the end.So good-bye, Proper_Noun Good-bye Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun all the house elves), even Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his Proper_Noun Proper_Noun We will miss all of you, every character we encountered, from Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to hippogriff and owl, and everything about the world you all so vibrantly inhabit. And to Proper_Noun Rowling: know that you have brought immeasurable joy to millions and millions of Proper_Noun worldwide, and know that we cannot possibly thank you enough. What a tremendous gift you were given. Thank you for sharing it with us.
