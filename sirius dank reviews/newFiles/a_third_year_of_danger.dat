6Thirteen-year-old Proper_Noun Proper_Noun knows he can\'t use Proper_Noun during his summer vacation. But try as he might, he accidentally blows up horrid Proper_Noun Proper_Noun like a giant balloon. Instead of being expelled from Proper_Noun he is met by the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun himself and allowed to stay at an inn for the rest of the summer holiday.The reason becomes clear right before the fall term starts. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has escaped from the wizard prison Proper_Noun He is a dangerous wizard who once killed thirteen innocent people with one spell. Worse, he worked for Proper_Noun And everyone thinks he is headed toward Proper_Noun to attack Proper_Noun if this weren\'t enough, Proper_Noun has his regular school work to do. There\'s a new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun teacher, one who actually seems popular this year. Professor Proper_Noun is as mean and vindictive as ever. Harry\'s new class, Proper_Noun starts with the dire prediction that one of the students will leave and never return. And Proper_Noun has a schedule that is impossibly full.But as the year wears on, it becomes alarmingly clear that Proper_Noun isn\'t safe within the walls of the school. Will Proper_Noun Proper_Noun be caught or will he get to Proper_Noun first?This is now the third Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book, and each one gets a little stronger. I have finally accepted that the books are as much about his school life as the mystery, but the mystery is being set up earlier and earlier in the books. The characters have been well established by this point, so the jokes between them immediately resonate with the reader. Yet a new comer could jump in here and understand the majority of the story.I can certainly see why these books are so popular. They are entertaining escapist fantasy. I\'m looking forward to sinking into book four.
