42In pure honesty, I will be astounded if anybody actually reads my review, but in case you actually would like my prognosis of this novel, read on.Before I begin, though, if you are a new reader who has never read any of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series, I would strongly recommend reading them in order. An avid fan, I have read all of the current ones several times, but Proper_Noun reviewing "The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun for the reason it is my favorite. Although "Goblet of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is undeniably deeper and well-written, I personally favor this one so far.For me, the first two books of this series served merely as an introduction into the wonderful world of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They allow the readers to begin to expand their mind enough to absorb the pure imagination in this magnificent fantasy. Again, that is why I urge new readers to read the first two before delving into this Proper_Noun Grammatically, it is no more difficult to read than the first two. Content wise, however, Proper_Noun Rowling goes all out in this one; as if she were holding back in the earlier ones. For a reader unexposed to this world, it may be overwhelming.For me, this Proper_Noun secured Proper_Noun Proper_Noun legitimacy as an author and was the turning point to get me hooked to the whole series, since it works on so many more levels than the previous two. In "Prisoner of Proper_Noun finally begins to shed some light on Proper_Noun past, an element very briefly touched in the prior two. You also begin to see the development of familiar characters; the progression and maturity from their initial introduction in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Part of Proper_Noun gift is making the reader feel as if they are at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun with the Proper_Noun and the rest. Once accustomed to the characters, we can see how they grow. Proper_Noun begins to experience some situations typical of a young, confused boy his age (ie, he starts to stand-up for himself more Proper_Noun his foster family, he starts rebelling more Proper_Noun his professors, he finds himself in the middle of a conflict between his two best friends, etc) As a growing teenager myself, I can relate. Also, in the previous books, the story was pretty clear-cut. Of course there were unexpected twists and curveballs thrown, but when it came down to it, the reader could easily discern between the good hero and the evil antagonist at the climax. This story focuses less on the ongoing battle between Proper_Noun and his archenemy and more on the inner turmoil of a young man as he is faced with several obstacles he has to face within himself.However, make no mistake, this story is jam-packed with action and humor that makes the Proper_Noun so appealing to begin with. And as I stated earlier, Rowling allows our imaginations to soar as she expands on the already well-developed world she has created. In a delightful turn of events, Proper_Noun is on his own for a few weeks, so we get a firsthand account about a "normal" city for wizards. Another plus is a newly introduced wizard settlement known as Proper_Noun in which Rowling vividly describes the various wild shops and landmarks. Finally, the introduction of a new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun teacher, a very interesting and well-developed man. Professor Proper_Noun Proper_Noun class allows Proper_Noun creativity to shine as she shows all these magical creatures and entities who are obviously researched and well-developed. Not only is it just fun to read, it\'s a great prerequisite for the totally outta-this-world follow-up, "Goblet of Proper_Noun I love this series, and I recommend that everybody at least read "Sorceror\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fer taking the time to read this, I hope it was helpful in convincing you that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is one of the best examples of literature at its best.
