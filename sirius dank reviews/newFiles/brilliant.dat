14J.K. Rowling has done it again! I\'m 15, and I just love the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books. (I\'m must say that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are two of my favorite characters) I don\'t think that there\'s anything evil with these books. Some people don\'t like them because there\'s witchcraft. There\'s no serious magic done in these books. The "witchcraft" almost isn\'t witchcraft. It\'s like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun with the good side and the bad side of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is on the good side of wizardry, whereas Proper_Noun has gone bad. I don\'t hear anyone trying to ban Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and I don\'t want anyone to try to ban Proper_Noun Proper_Noun from the schools. I highly recommend these books to everyone!
