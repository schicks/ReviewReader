35I am not the first to claim that the Proper_Noun potter series began to degrade when 1) the movies began to arrive and 2) Proper_Noun became so successful that editors will no longer touch her work. This clearly has affected her writing, most especially with Proper_Noun 6 (Half-Blood Proper_Noun and now the final installment.Unlike the magical stand-alone stories of the previous four books, Proper_Noun 7 is completely dependent on having read previous books. Gone is the wonder of the magical world; it is all about Proper_Noun having taken over authority (in the background, without any real fight by the wizarding community) and Proper_Noun quest to destroy the Proper_Noun strange sort of quest, seeing Proper_Noun doesn\'t realize for awhile they\'re being destroyed, and their individual loss does not seem to affect him in the least. The "Deathly Proper_Noun of the book, three magical objects that apparently all link together to master Proper_Noun ultimately don\'t have a real bearing on the final outcome. In the end, it is all about Proper_Noun sacrificing himself; something that could have been done without Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as they ultimately prove to be.There is a lack of real emotion in this book. Characters come and go Proper_Noun die) without a real sense of loss. It feels arbitrary and, in the case of Proper_Noun completely manipulated by the author. The only character who seems to rise above the moment is Proper_Noun but otherwise there is little sense of release or closure or excitment seeing these familiar characters in perilous experiences.I recommend the Proper_Noun only to see how the series finishes up, but buy it used or check it out from the library. I was hoping for a grand finish, and instead I got a first or second draft when a good polish Proper_Noun a real rethinking of the plot) could have made it extraordinary.
