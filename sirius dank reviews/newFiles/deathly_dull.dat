14I\'ve read the series, and it\'s fascinating how the entire saga went from initially interesting and entertaining with the first few books into to tedious chores to read. Deathly Proper_Noun is no exception. Wow, how this book dragged. The introduction and initial conflicts were interesting and exciting, but after the sequence where the children were offered alcohol(!) we are off into chapter after chapter of aimless tedium.You know, the previous books and their descriptions of Proper_Noun courses and teachers were one of the more interesting gimmicks of the Proper_Noun series. But all of that is gone here.Nope, now we get Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun on an endlessly dull camping trip, the details of which drag on and on on, with a seemingly aimless direction. Gosh, what I wouldn\'t have given for a quidditch match, or something to break the tedium.And what\'s the deal with these kids? Seven years later, and character-wise are they really any different? Do they really act or behave any differently? In fact, is their magic really all that much improved, even after six years of attending magic school?Gosh this book dragged. And the final battle with Proper_Noun completely anti-climatic! Harry utters some Shatnerian dialog then, Proper_Noun battle is over. Couldn\'t Proper_Noun has cyphoned a little of the tedious Proper_Noun exposition of the previous chapter and turned this into more of a climatic final showdown? It was over way to fast!As for the epilogue: I could have taken those pages and poured them on my pancakes this morning.Gosh, what a waste of time. When I stop to think of all the other books out there, why did I follow the inane hype and read this? I should have stopped at Proper_Noun which was my favorite of the bunch.Yeah yeah, thumbs down. Whatever. It helped to put my feelings into writing though. I\'ll save this review and forget about Proper_Noun and move on.
