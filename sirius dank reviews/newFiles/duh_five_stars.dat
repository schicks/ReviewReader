12I know there is already over a thousand reviews but I just hadto say something. Harry is back in Proper_Noun for his third year andnow there is an escaped prisoner searching for him! Sirius Proper_Noun killed 13 people with a single curse and now he is after Proper_Noun BUT Proper_Noun trouble doesn\'t end there. Hermione has recently bought an ugly cat called Proper_Noun who is after Proper_Noun pet rat Proper_Noun As Proper_Noun continues to chase Proper_Noun their friendship is wearing thin. AND that\'s not all. Professor Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun teacher, is totally convinced that Proper_Noun life will end very, very soon. I have read this book over 30 times (It\'s probably more than that but Proper_Noun not sure how many times it really is) and I still find it to be a new and intriguing story every time I pick it up, unlike most books that are spoiled once you read them once. If I could, I would rate this book five gabazillion stars. J.K., if you read this, I give you Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun
