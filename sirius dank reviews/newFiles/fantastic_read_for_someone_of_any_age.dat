23I am 27 years old and I have loved all three books in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series. I\'ve enjoyed watching Proper_Noun grow in each of the three books. I read these books and just delight in Proper_Noun characterizations and imagination. I got this book for Proper_Noun this year and yesterday was the first time I had to sit down and start reading. I couldn\'t go to bed until I finished the book.I read these books and I think how I can\'t wait to share Proper_Noun and his friends with my children someday. I think of how disappointed Proper_Noun be when the series ends, because already, I feel like I visit with old friends when I pick up these books.My thanks go out to Proper_Noun Rowling for sharing her wonderful gift with the world.I recommend this book to anyone of any age, it is garenteed not to disappoint!
