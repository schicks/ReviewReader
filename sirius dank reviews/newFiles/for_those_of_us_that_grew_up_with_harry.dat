153*SPOILERS: please don\'t read if you haven\'t finished the book*After reading the seventh and final installment of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series, as well as many of these reviews, I simply cannot believe that anyone would rate this book with less than 5 stars. I have read reviews where people say that the ending is too "light and fluffy", or that "Harry should have died", and that the whole deathly Proper_Noun part of the plot is pointless because, in the end, Proper_Noun does Proper_Noun keep the hallows. Can no-one here see why Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ended the series as she did? I grew up with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the first book having been released when I was about 9 or 10. I cannot express how depressing it would have been had Proper_Noun died, for(forgive me for the cheeziness) if Proper_Noun had died surely there was no hope for the rest of us. Furthermore, the ending is Proper_Noun "light and fluffy". Proper_Noun overcomes Proper_Noun as his character develops, as he finally understands how to finish the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun once and for all- as he allows himself to be sacrificed for the benefit of Proper_Noun greater good". The deathly Proper_Noun merely stand as the temptation for Proper_Noun to become all-powerful, to make the same mistake that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun he was young) made. His choice to turn down the opportunity to evade death Proper_Noun only speaks on his true character, but sets him apart from those who would try to harness this power. Even if Proper_Noun had chosen to keep the Proper_Noun for good purposes, would he Proper_Noun eventually turn into the same type of tyrant as Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun and as Proper_Noun would have become? Yes, the Proper_Noun did appear and disappear in this one book, but because Proper_Noun chose Proper_Noun to keep them for himself, he chose the path of the pure-hearted. By this action, we truly see how much Proper_Noun has grown and matured. We also see just how different Proper_Noun really is from Proper_Noun a question Proper_Noun himself had been wondering for some time.So for those of you that bash this book for Proper_Noun ending in total destruction, and claim that "life is Proper_Noun fair and evil really does win", please remember that life is only what you make of it. Only those of us who grew up with Proper_Noun can really say just how much his life means to us, and I would just like to thank Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for this wonderful finishing piece of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series.
