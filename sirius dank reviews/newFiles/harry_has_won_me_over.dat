6I\'m 25 years old, and in less than a week I have become enchanted with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun A good friend at work introduced the series to me, and I laughingly told her that I would give it a try. Now Proper_Noun finished the third in the series and am waiting for her to catch up to me! I can\'t wait for the fourth book to be released! J. K. Rowling has a most special talent in creating such vivid and enchanting novels. No wonder readers of all ages anxiously await her fourth book! These stories will awaken your imagination and take you on some wonderful and amazing trips! I can\'t wait for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun due out this summer! :)
