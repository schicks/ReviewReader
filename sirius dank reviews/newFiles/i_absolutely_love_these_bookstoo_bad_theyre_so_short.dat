8I don\'t normally read "children\'s books," but I have always had a soft spot for fantasy, my favorite genre (particularly books involving magic and talking mice, for some reason). I had never intended to ready any of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books, but my mother, acting on a whim, bought the first two volumes for me, saying that they were Proper_Noun popular. The books sat unread in my room for weeks, until late one Proper_Noun night, when I read both books, finishing at 3 Proper_Noun and neglecting to translate my Proper_Noun assignment. The books were great! I immediately bought the 3rd installment, which I read immediately that afternoon. I find it easy to identify with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who reminds me of myself sometimes. Particularly, I enjoy references to Latin in the books (such as the first example, caput draconis, head of Proper_Noun in book 1.) The twisted plot at the end of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun intrigued me, compelling me to read the last few chapters multiple times to fully grasp all of it winding lines. The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun took a step away from what I view as the first and second books\' major fallacy: the repetitive plot line. Proper_Noun has a bad time with his family, goes to school, has trouble with a permutation of Proper_Noun defeats Proper_Noun and gets congratulated by everbody, helping his house win the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The third book remediated this problem, since it wasn\'t clear who the villan was until the Proper_Noun end. My larges gripe with the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books is now length. I read the books in a little over two hours each. Its rather torturous to wait for weeks on end for two hours of enjoyment. I wish the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books could be more like the books of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in that area: enjoyable and interesting, but abysmally long. (My average reading time for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is surpassed only by Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun To end on a positive note, I am happy to award my five stars to "Harry Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun in appreciation to Proper_Noun correction of some of the problems with the first books and my opinion that the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books are Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I dread what will happen after the seventh book, when Proper_Noun has graduated from school. Will he be a professor, or set out on his own? Or Proper_Noun just (sob! sob! sob!) terminate the series? I fervently hope the books will never be lost to that extreme! (If you have read my whole spiel, I thank you Proper_Noun much for hearing me out and not averting your gaze in disgust, boredom, outright anger or whatever else my review might drive you to.
