85than we would have had a book and story that would have truly done justice to the magical world and characters that Proper_Noun Rowling had created over the years. Let me be clear, the book was not a complete let down, and the major plot lines and questions that had been hanging in the air were answered, all of which were already solved by me after reading the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mention this because for some the fact that there are no more major twists waiting for them may be a disappointment, but for others that believe in the "other" way there will be, I suppose, a major twist... I just never could see why people saw it that way as the author took the time to clearly set up the plot line over the course of the previous books...). The problem with the book, however, lies in the fact that it takes over half of the book to get the plot rolling under any momentum whatsoever, and once it gets rolling there have already been a number of ridiculously concocted narrow escapes and shallow plot developments.The first half of the book (after the chase scene, which was the only narrow escape sub-plot that really worked well in the book and seemed very well crafted) seems to drag with no real point. Though I understand some of the author\'s intentions in this half of the book were to tie up loose ends on sub-plots for characters, none of the sections read well and the book seemed to drag on endlessly in a non-focused manner, which was readily portrayed in the fact that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his usual sidekicks had no idea where they were supposed to start. After things pick up on the plot front, only slightly, more narrow escapes surface, but these just seemed slapped together with no real care in development of them, and made me feel like I was watching a predictably scripted and developed Proper_Noun action flick with a ridiculous escape angle that wouldn\'t hold water if it were a bucket; this is something that she has, previously, been able to avoid. I always recognized the narrow escape themes in the books previously, but she did so well to draw her readers into them and engross them into the books that you felt that they were, well possible and even likely - as though it could happen to you.To make matters worse even when the plot gets rolling the author still can\'t give up her fancy to add as many narrow escape sub-plots to the book as she possibly can which just seem far too unrealistic, even in the wizarding world. Sadly, it is because of these ridiculous narrow escape escapades the author makes the once formidable opposition to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that she handily crafted in the first six books, seem like a hair-brained dolts, nitwits, and completely inept characters, making you wonder why it took six books to finish them off - the way they act in this book even the eleven year-old Proper_Noun could have taken them on and defeated them, without wizard training.Another bad move by the author came when she readily used ideas in the major plot line of the book from other books as if they were her own, a few of which would be the books that make up the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun While she has always cleverly referred to other, outside sources as inspiration to her works in the past, including both real world and fictional references, she never directly took from the major plot lines and incorporated them into her works - until now. As I am not trying to divulge the story or spoil anyone\'s enjoyment of the book I can\'t go into detail, but I am sure many of you will sniff out what I am talking about immediately. I was severely disappointed in this aspect of the book, and it, along with the poorly developing plot and ridiculous narrow escapes made me want to put down the book for good several times, but, like the rest of you, I had to finish what I started, and I plowed through until I reached...the gem of the book that lies within its final 8 chapters. Without trying to give too many details I will say that she holds the major twist of the books as a whole, the one I alluded to previously and had already predicted, until these chapters, as well as the scenes that truly made trudging through the rest of the book worth it. The final battle scenes held up to the expectations that they were given by the readers, and they were a joy to read. The final chapters of the book encompass the flavor and feeling that the last book should have held throughout - the sense of urgency, the feeling of finality, and the overwhelming dread and horror that faced each and every character that we came to know and love if they failed... if Proper_Noun won... prior to these wonderfully written and gut-wrenching scenes in the finale you never would have known how urgent the situation really was, and how real the fear of The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun claiming the world was within each of them.I can\'t say that I am completely disappointed with the book, but, unfortunately I left thinking that, overall, the series went out with a whimper and not the bang that I expected. Walking into the book I fully expected that when I reached the end I would hate it - it would mean that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun world was finally closed to me forever - and that I would be begging her to write one more book, but, in the end, I found the opposite to be true. I was glad it was over, and I was glad I had finished reading about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun world. Maybe this was the intention of the author in creating this final book in her series, but if so I certainly believe she could have found a much more creative and challenging way to do it then making her final book in the series the weakest book of all.
