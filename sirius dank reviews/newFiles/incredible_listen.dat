7Jim Proper_Noun is incredible for the entire series, but he does his best work yet for the climax of the 7 audiobooks. I actually get more out of the audiobook than I do out of reading the book, because I tend to read to fast and end up skimming important details. With the audiobook, Proper_Noun listening at a nice even pace, and get everything.The combination of Proper_Noun Rowling\'s descriptive writing, and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun performance can\'t be beat! :)
