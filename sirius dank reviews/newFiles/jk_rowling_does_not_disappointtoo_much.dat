28Rowling does a tremendous job with this book. Though some criticize this book as being the darkest of the series, it is not as bad as it is made out to be. While there is killing, and a good quantity of people die, it\'s not as if Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has suddenly turned into the latest action movie, filled with wanton destruction. You see crucial character development, as you learn what Proper_Noun and his friends are made of, and see what they are willing to sacrifice to defeat Proper_Noun In between you see the awkward romances, the constant (and completely expected) bickering, gut wrenching scenes, and the sometimes unintentional comedy/bravery that defines these latest Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books. Most of what happens in this seventh book is allueded to in the previous Proper_Noun Most of you can probably guess what happens in this book.Don\'t be so sure of yourselves. Rowling keeps you guessing almost until the end about what will really happen. Skipping straight to the end will tell you what happens, but not why it happens, and this book is all about the journey, not the destination.That journey does seem to take an overly long time to resolve, however. What begins and ends as a fast paced tale does bog down a bit in the middle. It\'s hard to discern why the characters are doing what they are doing, and that part of the book could have been sped up a bit.Personally, I would have also liked a bit more resolution as well. Rowling does a tremendous job of building up to a climax... and then the book ends quickly. By no means do we just fade to black, but a couple of more pages of resolution would have been nice, to encompass more of the supporting characters.I got this book and could not put it down. I started reading as soon as I got back from the store, and Proper_Noun have to say, this is in my opinion, the best Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book, and a fitting end to the series.
