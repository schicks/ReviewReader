34Harry Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun A title that had an entire world hanging breathless, watching the clock click down to 12:01. I know, I was there. I got my copy and opened it immediately, reading as I walked out of the bookstore, reading as I walked up the sidewalk, reading as I got into the car, reading (when the streetlights allowed) in the car.And I know Proper_Noun not alone, and Proper_Noun not alone in my disappointment, either.This is just being plain cynical, but, to quote someone I know, "I guess when you\'re richer than the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun it doesn\'t matter." Proper_Noun rather sure that\'s not what happened with Proper_Noun or at least I hope that\'s not the case. Honestly speaking, though, I expect Rowling to pop up at any second and say, Proper_Noun kidding! Here\'s the real book!"That\'s not going to happen, though, so here are the reasons Proper_Noun so disappointed in Proper_Noun As I promised, spoiler free.1) Plot holes. Lots of them, too.2) Predictability. What happened to the Proper_Noun way!" in Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun or even Proper_Noun Themeitis--things happening for the sake of theme, not because they would actually happen naturally.4) Plot devices--they were there5) The deaths. I won\'t say who dies, but only one death was satisfactory. The other(s) all got Proper_Noun (only word I can think of) and pushed to the side, as if the person/people was/were never important.6) A sloppy plot. It screamed of "scraped together at last minute," to me, though I might just be bitter and cynical again.7) Worst last three words of any book I can think of. WHY??What do you know--7 reasons I find HP7 just average. It had plenty of redeeming qualities which saved it from 2 stars, such as usual Proper_Noun humor, usual Proper_Noun fast pace, and a certain side plot, one involving a certain greasy-haired, dry-humored person, that was absolutely brilliant. Nevertheless, Proper_Noun weighing this book against its own potential, and it just didn\'t fill its own shoes.But, the other Proper_Noun books are better, in my opinion. My final conclusion is buy it, read it, but don\'t expect to love it. It wasn\'t that fantastic, and the more you sit and anaylze the book Proper_Noun tried to just enjoy it, but that proved futile) the less you like it...
