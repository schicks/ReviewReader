9i am 16 years old, and i started reading the harry potter series when my 10-year old sister got all three for her birthday. i don\'t think i have ever read a better "children" series--i really couldn\'t put them down, especially the third one, which i read twice to catch anything i had missed the first time. these stories have no age limits -- anyone can read them and enjoy themselves completely. my compliments to Proper_Noun K. Rowlings. the whole idea of hogwarts, the pictures that can talk and move, the magical creatures, hagrid, and of course, ron and hermione is just so cool. This book just makes everyone imagine what it would be like to get a letter Proper_Noun owl post of course) saying that you possessed magical powers and telling you to go to diagon alley to buy your wizard supplies. i thought that the third one was the best so far--so many unexpected things happened that it was too exciting to put down. this is the best series i have ever read adn i can\'t wait for the fourth one to come out!
