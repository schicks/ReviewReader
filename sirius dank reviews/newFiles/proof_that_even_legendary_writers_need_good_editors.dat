15I have to say it, Proper_Noun K. Rowling needs a good editor. There are parts of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that drag on needlessly, and with another polish this book could have been much tighter, much stronger and much more enjoyable.When Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is at its best it captures all the magic we\'ve come to expect from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series, but it\'s only at its best about 60% of the time. Rowling is capable of better and her earlier books reflect that fact.It\'s actually quite problematic to judge Proper_Noun Proper_Noun individually. In many ways it exists more as a series capper than anything else, and in that capacity it does its job fairly well: all questions are answered, all conflicts resolved and at the end of the book you get the satisfaction of having gone through this long journey.I wasn\'t crazy about the very end, but it was a sobering reminder that this indeed IS a children\'s series. And while it definitely appeals to adults, the core intended audience is kids and teens.If you\'re a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fan, no review is going to change your mind in any way about this book. But if you\'re new to the series and looking to \'check it out\', don\'t start with book 7. The first three books in this series are by far the best.So farewell Proper_Noun we\'ll miss you. That is until the next movie hits screens and there\'s Proper_Noun fever all over again.One final note to whoever publishes Proper_Noun Rowling\'s next book. Rowling is an immense talent with a fantastical vision. But she\'s just a writer, and like even the best writer she needs and editor. Someone to call her on her bad habits, help her keep her prose focused and bring out the best in what she has to offer.
