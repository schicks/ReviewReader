9The 37-year-old Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fan that I am, I know I am not Proper_Noun target audience. That said, I was disappointed by some of this installment\'s contrivances, repetition, and lack of smart and witty dialog. For example, some of the clues Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun seek just sort of appear out of nowhere, causing this reader to pause and raise an eyebrow, and more than a couple battles conclude with Proper_Noun regaining consciousness, having blacked out at the end. However these disappointments did not stop me from inhaling the book; I was definitely hooked. The battle cry of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was chilling and exhilarating, and the final show down pretty satisfying, too. One thing though: did an editorial assistant write the epilogue? Seriously?
