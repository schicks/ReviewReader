31I\'m a teacher so I decided to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun &amp; the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to see what all the hoop-lah is about. After reading all three of her Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels, it\'s easy to see how Proper_Noun fascinating books made it to the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and why they are the favorite of children AND adults everywhere! Rowling has done a cosmic job creating Proper_Noun as well as the various other young wizards and witches of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The reader can almost feel the sensation as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun vanish through the wall to get to platform nine and three-quarters, feel the tickle as a young wizard accidentally walks through Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (one of the many ghosts that resides in Proper_Noun feel the thrill as Proper_Noun leads his team to victory in Proper_Noun or feel the numbing cold as you-know-who makes an appearance or the dementors come walking by. Peaked your curiousity? I would recommend this book to any parent and child looking for a fun, intellectually-stimulating, imaginative book to read!
