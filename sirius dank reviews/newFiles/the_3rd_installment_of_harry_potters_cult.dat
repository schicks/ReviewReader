13Harry Proper_Noun young boy... wizard... Hogwarts... Ron and Proper_Noun Dursleys... these words open a gate to a wide world, from the imagination of Proper_Noun Rowling. This 3rd installment of this wonderful series managed to hook me up from page 1. I developed a keenship with the characters, living their adventures, experiencing their problems and happiness and pain. This book is written with such passion it can please both children and adults. And being 19, Proper_Noun not exactly a child anymore. From all the books, this has been the one that had pleased me more and I am sure the more I read the more it\'ll please me to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I especially liked the characters in this book. I enjoyed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the most, and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun quartet as well... I recommend this book to everyone, child or adult, besides recommending the previous ones too. And, let\'s just say Proper_Noun Rolwing knows how to write with feeling, and depth.
