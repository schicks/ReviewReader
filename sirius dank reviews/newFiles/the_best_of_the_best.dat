9Spoiler Proper_Noun Proper_Noun feelings on The Proper_Noun are some what inexpressible, other then to say, I was completely floored, Proper_Noun opened the flood gates on her talent and let it pure out. In an interview with The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun said that she was determined to write the best book possible. I think that she succeeded by a landslide. In all the months of waiting and wading through all Proper_Noun personal speculation, I couldn\'t have imagined a better ending. Even had the series gone on for another seven books.So.. Do I Think book 7 holds the answers to all the burning questions we\'ve been asking? in the main yes, in as far as they were relevant to the plot, and to Proper_Noun overall vision. Did 7 fulfill everything I expected? Not everything no, there were somthings left out that Proper_Noun said would be included. but to be fair a lot was probably lost or changed during the editing process, Proper_Noun curious about certain things of course, but given the finshed product, I can\'t complain. It is I think Proper_Noun favorite of the series, followed by Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Jo really gave us and Proper_Noun her whole heart in this one. The result is not only one of the bust series closers Proper_Noun ever read, but bar non one of the best books period.Saying goodbye to Proper_Noun was very difficult to say the least, I read extra slow jut to hold on a little longer, I even got the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in part because of the expanded page count cotaining full page chapter illustrations, which in a small way extended the experience, and made the book into somthing of a keepsake.Like many millions of Proper_Noun fans, I will miss the nail biting wait, wild speculation, and finally the ultimate satisfaction of holding that next novel in Proper_Noun hands. And I sort of pity the coming generations of Proper_Noun Fans that they won\'t really get to feel what it was like.My Proper_Noun sits proudly with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun just waiting to be reread, and I will, so really it\'s not goodbye but rather hello again and again.
