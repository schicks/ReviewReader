7At first I was embarrassed to be in my thirties and reading these books in public, but that\'s before I became hooked. I read this last one on an airplane trip and I was so absorbed that the plane could have crashed and I wouldn\'t have noticed. It\'s hard to imagine that these books keep getting better, but they do! With such great villains as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and even more quiddich playing, how could you go wrong. Adults need not be ashamed -- run out, read these books and regain your childhood imagination. This was my favorite of the first 3 books.
