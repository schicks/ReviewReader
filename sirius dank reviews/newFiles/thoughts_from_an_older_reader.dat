6I absolutely recommend reading the whole "Harry Proper_Noun series! I am 23 yrs. old and I think Rowling has to done a wonderful job to create a whole new magical world for kids today. When I was younger, I read A Proper_Noun of books (and I still do) and this new series can definitely join the list of time-tested classics for kids like Proper_Noun Lewis\' Proper_Noun chronicles; Proper_Noun and much more. Rowling in fact, creates a whole different type of classic! I\'m always drawn to the story and characters; I read it in one sitting (about 2 hrs.); and I use the books as an escape from the stress of being a law student! Parents, teens, kids, and everyone should read the series!
