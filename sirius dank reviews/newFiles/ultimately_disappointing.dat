7**** SPOILERS Proper_Noun . . . if you haven\'t read the book, please be warned! ****JK Proper_Noun final installment in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun franchise is a clunky, over-stuffed opus that\'s ultimately disappointing. One gets the sense, in reading this novel for the second time, that Proper_Noun found herself having great difficulty concluding her saga in one volume - after all, the previous six books have each focused on one school year in the lives of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun as they prepared themselves for the expected war between the forces of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The war itself, as compressed into this one book, feels rushed, bloated, summarized at times, and unsatisfying.Basically, `Deathly Proper_Noun is a novel about choices - should Proper_Noun spend his time seeking Proper_Noun (magical objects containing parts of Proper_Noun evil soul) or Proper_Noun (magical objects purported to give their possessor dominion over death)? Proper_Noun has instructed Proper_Noun to go after the Proper_Noun since finding and destroying all seven is the only way to finally destroy Proper_Noun But the lure of the Proper_Noun is great, and Proper_Noun finds himself obsessed with finding the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Searching for Proper_Noun isn\'t particularly glamorous (and it keeps the trio out of the battle for most of the novel), but it does bring our heroes closer to their ultimate goal (destroying Proper_Noun Searching for Proper_Noun would be more fun (and probably more exciting for readers of this story). In the end, Proper_Noun must make the ultimate choice - self-sacrifice or self-preservation. The search for the Proper_Noun symbolizes that self-sacrifice (especially since one of the seven Proper_Noun ends up being inside Proper_Noun while the search for the Proper_Noun symbolizes personal power and self-preservation. The final show-down between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun puts it all into perspective - Proper_Noun has put all his hopes into the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which he believes will protect him and give him dominion over death; Proper_Noun offers himself to death willingly. Proper_Noun willingness to sacrifice his own life for the greater Proper_Noun is what gives him the power to defeat Proper_Noun that\'s what the novel is about. Unfortunately, to get there Proper_Noun has to throw in a ton of exposition as she explains what Proper_Noun are, what Proper_Noun really mean, and how wands really work. Her characters jump from action scene to action scene, spending the time between explaining to each other (and the reader) what actually happened and why it\'s important. It feels a bit like an action film that stops every 15 minutes so that the director can step forward and explain things to the audience. In the end, we discover that the Proper_Noun really aren\'t important to the story at all (other than as a symbol), and even the Proper_Noun end up feeling anti-climactic once that ghostly Proper_Noun starts in on that long and confusing explanation of how Proper_Noun himself is a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it\'s all a bit ridiculous). Add to all that the convoluted "rules" Proper_Noun sets up in this book surrounding the use of wands (none of which were part of the previous 6 books) and you get a book jam-packed with "stuff" that gets in the way of the story.And that\'s what\'s lacking here - the story. Most of the actual war takes place elsewhere, as we readers are stuck with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are hiding out in the country-side, thinking about Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun We hear (in passing) that things are happening at Proper_Noun and at the Proper_Noun but we see little of it until the novel\'s climax. Major characters Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun especially) have very little to do in this novel. We never get the Proper_Noun scene Proper_Noun looked forward to since the first book, nor do we get any resolution between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The final show-down between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is disappointing - too much talk and too little real action. In the end, Proper_Noun wins because of those Proper_Noun "rules." He doesn\'t beat Proper_Noun - Proper_Noun mistake about the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ends up undoing him Proper_Noun really wouldn\'t have mattered at all what Proper_Noun did or didn\'t do).To make matters worse, Proper_Noun ends her novel two and a half pages after the Proper_Noun showdown. After hundreds of pages about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and wands, we get nothing about how these characters handle the aftermath of this epic war. How does Proper_Noun deal with the deaths of his friends? How do the Proper_Noun deal with Proper_Noun What happens to little Proper_Noun . . . or Proper_Noun . . . or countless others mentioned only in passing? What is it like for epic heroes to come home from the war and face life again? What has been lost? What has been gained? This is the heart of this series of novels - the quest has always been to find a way to live in peace and love and harmony. Proper_Noun gives us none of that, however.Except in that awful Proper_Noun She gives us seven pages on Proper_Noun 9 Proper_Noun set 19 years after the battle at Proper_Noun We see Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and even Proper_Noun and his wife . . . all with children of their own ready to begin their magical education at Proper_Noun We learn that Proper_Noun is fine (orphaned but resilient), Proper_Noun is a professor at Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun has given his oldest son Proper_Noun name Proper_Noun as a middle name anyway - the boy is called Proper_Noun Proper_Noun We\'re supposed to be happy about all this suburban bliss, all these comfortably complacent families waiting together for the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun But what has changed in this world? What was all that Proper_Noun vs. Evil stuff all about? Is the magical world still hidden and separate from the Proper_Noun world? Wasn\'t it part of the fight to bring those two worlds together once and for all? Is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun still a bastion for bigots and racists? Little Proper_Noun Proper_Noun worries that the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun might put him in Proper_Noun - and Proper_Noun tries to tell him that one of his namesakes, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was a Proper_Noun and the bravest man he has ever known. If that\'s true, then why, after 19 years, are children still labeling Proper_Noun as dark and evil? If Proper_Noun is gone, if the war has been won, why aren\'t all of the Proper_Noun at Proper_Noun united for the common good? I guess we\'ll never know.Overall, `Deathly Proper_Noun isn\'t a bad read. All of us who love these characters will enjoy immersing ourselves in their world one last time. It just isn\'t the book it could have been . . . or the book it should have been. It\'s a disappointment, and since it\'s the last book we\'ll probably ever read about Proper_Noun world, that\'s a shame. So I give it 2 \xbd stars - rounded up to 3 because it\'s Proper_Noun after all.
