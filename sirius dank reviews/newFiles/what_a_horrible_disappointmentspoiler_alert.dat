15After years of waiting for the final showdown, this is the best Proper_Noun could give us? We were thoroughly disappointed.She had greatness in her grasp and had mapped it out perfectly. Snape was going to go down. That was a given. Anyone could have guessed that, for Proper_Noun sake, he would die defending Proper_Noun However, instead of the blaze of honorable, brave glory that he deserved after years as Proper_Noun protector, Proper_Noun has him walk right into his death, and poof, he\'s gone. Didn\'t even get to draw his wand or even knick old Proper_Noun Not fair! Shame on her!And... it was a bloodbath! She killed off so many beloved characters! No one was safe by the end! The worst were Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and a Proper_Noun We half expected Proper_Noun to get it in the end. It was horrible and senseless! She even kills off Tonks and Proper_Noun leaving Proper_Noun an orphan! Just nasty! And yet the Proper_Noun emerge without casualties! What was she thinking?And then, the worst was that we get to see them all years later! Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the brightest witch of her age is now doing what? She seems to be a housewife!?!?! Only Proper_Noun appears to be doing something with his life. The rest are all just playing house out in suburbia?!?!?! What kind of ending is that? Harry Proper_Noun dad, husband, lawnmower?!?!? Please! What kind of ending is that?And the middle is just plain boring. Pages and pages of hiding in the woods....Talk about anti climactic!Honestly, Proper_Noun had the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun since year 1 but, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun never told him that there was this story about the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun What the heck was she thinking!She wrote like she was tired and just wanted to wrap it up already.I loved the time we had between books 6 &amp; 7 when we all tried to guess how it would go down! That was fun! We had so much better ideas than Proper_Noun Shame.All it was, in the end, was an ending. Oh, well.
