Dear Miss Granger,Now that you have completed your seventh year of Hogwarts (I assume you got academic credit for your interesting "internship" hunting Horcruxes and Hallows) and are preparing to join the working world, I am writing to offer you the post of my assistant librarian.  Your conduct in Book 7 of the Harry Potter series has convinced me that you would make a superb Assistant Stern Librarian:Your love of books was never more apparent than when you packed your magical backpack and spent so much time deciding which volumes should be taken along with the tent, clothes and food.  That is just like me packing for vacation.Your wide reading always seems to save the day--case in point, when a certain otherwise superb wizard did not know the importance of Godrick\'s Hollow, your knowledge of Bagshott\'s The History of Magic kept him on the right track.Your ability to whip up a good dish from scrounged mushrooms shows you can get by on a librarian\'s salary.Dumbledore left you a book in his will--and as far as I am concerned that says everything about your mission in life.As the main Muggle-born character you embody the soul of this series\' message of tolerance and you are the one character who NEVER abandons Harry Potter in the Deathly Hallows.Oh, and slightly off the topic, since you seem to have moved on, could you tell Victor Krum I am a huge fan and give him my number!  Your peer in reading,The Stern Librarian (I could also use your help with my Silencing Spells).
