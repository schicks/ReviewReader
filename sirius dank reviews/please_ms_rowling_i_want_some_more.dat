When you\'re into a series, you expect the quality to decline at some point. Azkaban doesn\'t do that at all, in fact it exceeded my very high expectations. My 38-year-old husband and I raced through all the books, and  we\'ve read them to our six-year-old as well, who thoroughly enjoyed them  too.I can\'t believe I have to wait another seven months to spend time  with Harry, Ron and Hermione! To the critics-Bah Humbug! The violence is  not excessive, the wizards are both good and bad(Hmmm, just like us!). In  fact the best thing about the books is that they\'re about children who we  can see ourselves in. These books get some children (I know one!) to read  who never read before, and they simply make you feel great.
