_Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_ is a wonderful addition Rowling\'s series.  It is the third book in the series, which should be read *in order.*  It\'s the best way to understand and to fully enjoy the series.  Book 3 is somewhat more complex and more mature than Book 1 and Book 2.  I  enjoyed Books 1 and 2; Book 3 made me a true Harry Potter devotee.  I think  its plot has considerably more emotional weight.  It\'s not just a  pleasantly exciting story; it deals with issues of trust and friendship  that make you feel and think as you read.The basic premise of the book  is simple: Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and is  on the loose, looking for Harry.  Adventures ensue.  A wonderful character  (perhaps my favorite in the series to date), Professor Remus Lupin, joins  the Hogwarts cast.  The book contains fascinating revelations about Harry\'s  family and draws on small clues offered in the earlier books.As an  evangelical Christian and an avid reader of fantasy, I\'m aware that certain  other Christians  have condemmed the Harry Potter series as supporting the  occult.  That\'s pure rubbish.  I would suggest that parents of very young  Potter fans be careful to supervise the reading of Book 3 by their  children.  It is rather more frightening than its predecessors.  Older  children should be fine.All in all, _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of  Azkaban_ is a wonderful novel for children.  Adult fans of Rowlings will  also find a lot to enjoy in it.  (Note: Pay attention to the characters\'  names.  There are hints hidden within them!).  This book and the series as  a whole are highly recommended.
