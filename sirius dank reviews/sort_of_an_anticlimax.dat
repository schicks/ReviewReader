The "Harry Potter" series will remain as a hallmark of popular culture and a hopeful sign for those of us who want literacy to spread and prevail.  Tens of millions of people, children and adults alike, were inspired to read thousands of pages of prose, to immerse themselves in a world of imagination and to feel the pull of fiction, to lose themselves in the world of books.That being said, the final volume was a bit of a letdown.  Thick as an encyclopedia, it promised great things, but was actually a bit flat, and the story was both uneventful and not terribly revelatory.  After a slam-bang opening, the book slides into a five-hundred page doldrum, where Harry, Hermione and Ron evade the dark forces of the evil sorcerer Voldemort by hiding in a magic tent and moving from location to location so that they cannot be tracked down.  They take brief forays out into the world, but mostly they stay in the tent and talk about their predicament. The book is top-heavy with exposition, exposition, exposition, and the scenes where Harry interacts with others often feel flat and perfunctory.  Ms. Rowling was obviously trying to hammer out her grand conclusion, and it feels workmanlike and uninspired. It\'s all very readable, and the chapters will quickly whiz by, but many readers may find themselves wondering at the end, "was that really all there is?" Key chunks of information are handed to us wholesale, in long, thunky chapters.  All is  explained, but it isn\'t terribly mindblowing, and it is a bit of a deflation, considering the darkness and sharp change of tone in the previous volume: the final Harry Potter book promised to take the series to a new level, into a more adult realm.  I suppose, it does -- on the face of things -- but the supposed grimness is facile, and the series ends on a decidedly treacly note.The phenomenal success of the series clearly became intertwined with the demands of feeding a multi-zillion dollar movie franchise, and in addition to writing some passages with the cinema in mind (the descriptions of certain magical acts became much more visual and detailed, almost like production notes for the special effects crew...) While "The Deathly Hallows" may have succeeded in wrapping up the series, Rowling dropped the ball in literary terms -- this was a much more pedestrian, unimaginative work than it could have otherwise been.  It\'s entertaining, but ephemeral. (Axton)
