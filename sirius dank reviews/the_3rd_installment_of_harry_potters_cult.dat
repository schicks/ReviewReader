Harry Potter... young boy... wizard... Hogwarts... Ron and Hermione... Dursleys... these words open a gate to a wide world, from the imagination of J.K. Rowling. This 3rd installment of this wonderful series managed to  hook me up from page 1. I developed a keenship with the characters, living  their adventures, experiencing their problems and happiness and pain. This  book is written with such passion it can please both children and adults.  And being 19, I\'m not exactly a child anymore. From all the books, this has  been the one that had pleased me more and I am sure the more I read the  more it\'ll please me to read Harry Potter. I especially liked the  characters in this book. I enjoyed Remus Lupin and Sirius Black the most,  and the Prongs, Moony, Padfoot and Wormtail quartet as well... I recommend  this book to everyone, child or adult, besides recommending the previous  ones too. And, let\'s just say J.K. Rolwing knows how to write with feeling,  and depth.
