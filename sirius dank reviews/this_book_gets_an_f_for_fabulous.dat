I love reading, so of course you, the critical reviewer who is trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, is turned off by that first line.  Perhaps this will persuade you. I read the first chapter of this book to my  five-year old sister. She does not share my passion for the written word,  nor does she appreciate fantasy-type games or TV shows. The night after,  she got up, TURNED OFF THE TV, and asked for more.  That, my friends, is  the markings of a wonderful book. If it could pull in my sister, and  immerse her into the world so thouroughly that she would turn off her  friend, the TV, then I think this book is truly a marvel.
