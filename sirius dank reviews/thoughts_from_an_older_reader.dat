I absolutely recommend reading the whole "Harry Potter" series! I am 23 yrs. old and I think Rowling has to done a wonderful job to create a whole new magical world for kids today.  When I was younger, I read A LOT  of books (and I still do) and this new series can definitely join the list  of time-tested classics for kids like C.S. Lewis\' Narnia chronicles;  Tolkien; and much more.  Rowling in fact, creates a whole different type of  classic! I\'m always drawn to the story and characters; I read it in one  sitting (about 2 hrs.); and I use the books as an escape from the stress of  being a law student! Parents, teens, kids, and everyone should read the  series!
