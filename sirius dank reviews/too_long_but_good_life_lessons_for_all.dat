Since this is the first Harry Potter book I have read, I had no preconceived ideas. Despite being almost eight hundred pages long, it was very well written. There is an abundance of exciting action throughout, with the lulls coming at just the right time. There are duels, battles, daring escapes, &amp; odd twists of fortune. The growth &amp; pairings of the characters showed signs of deep friendship &amp; TLC. The author paints vivid pictures &amp; the lines between good &amp; evil are visible for all to see. The cult of "moral relativism," was refreshingly absent.I found Harry\'s strong principles made him a very endearing character, he fought hard for what he believed in even if he suffered for it. Yes readers, the author told us some would die in this story. But, maybe not who you think? The secondary theme that love has redemptive qualities was also a good lesson for all readers regardless of age. Despite, it being about a hundred pages too long, "Deathly Hallows" was a truly great read. J.K.Rowling\'s imagination &amp; artistic style won this reader over. I will surely read all of her past &amp; future books.
