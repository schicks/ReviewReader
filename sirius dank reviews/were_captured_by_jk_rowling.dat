The twists and turns in The Prisoner of Azkaban keep you flipping through page after page to find out what happens to Harry and his friends.  No one we know has been disappointed by the third book in Rowling\'s spectacular series.  We recommend this book for kids, teenagers, adults, and even a  pesky rat or two.  It\'s the best fantasy of the millennium!  Angela, Amy,  Hilary, Heather, Jesse
