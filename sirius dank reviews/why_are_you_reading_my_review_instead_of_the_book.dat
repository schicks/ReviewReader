J.K Rowling captures the hearts of not only the children but also adults alike who are captivated by the world of mystical magic and wizards and witches, et al.The third instalment of the series, Harry Potter And The  Prisoner Of Azkaban, plays on the same tune the previous two books she has  worked on and Rowling manages to seamlessly infuse some elements from the  debut book into this one. For example, there is a small anecdote on how  Hagrid had gotten the bike from Sirius Black in "Prisoner Of  Azkaban" which was mentioned very briefly in the first book. It may be  very inconspicuous to note, but it just amazes me as though Rowling has  already planned to write beyond the first book when she was working on her  debut novel.There are further twists within the twists in the fate that  lies ahead of Harry Potter and his gang, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger,  and his entourage of Rubeus Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore, Prof McGonagall.  Throw in some interesting new characters, like the  "mis-fortune-telling" Prof Trelawny and Sirius Black, and not  forgetting his adversaries, Prof Serverus Snape and Draco Malfoy, and we\'ve  got another year of excitement and titillating, intense fun of the magical  School of Hogwarts.
