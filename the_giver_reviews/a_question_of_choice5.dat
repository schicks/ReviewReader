In the wonderfully imaginative mind of Lois Lowry, a futuristic Community has been created where there is no more war, no more suffering, no more starvation, no more unemployment, no more choices.  Everyone is seemingly happy.  This is where a Twelve named Jonas lives.  He is selected one day to be the Receiver of Memory of his society by the Elders of the Community.  This is the highest honor to receive and at first Jonas is nervous, but excited to start training.  But once under the instruction of his mentor, The Giver, who teaches him the truth about the choices his ancestors made, Jonas begins to understand the pain involved in bearing the burden of truth.  Together with the Giver, he makes the tough decision to initiate change, if he can survive long enough to do so.This book was one of the most engaging books I have ever read. Lowry has a talent for creating memorable characters and uses stark details that place the reader right alongside Jonas.  She also has a knack for lucid pacing and dialogue.  This book examines the question of the choices we might make to "make this world a better place," and the sacrifice that comes with comfort. I recommend this novel to readers of all ages.
