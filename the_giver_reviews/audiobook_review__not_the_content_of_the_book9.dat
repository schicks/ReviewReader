I purchased the audio version of The Giver last year so one of my students whose comprehension is excellent but decoding skills are still emergent could read the book.  He enjoyed listening to it, so I decided to use it with my seventh grade class.  The man who reads the story has a pretentious way of talking that the students objected to.  That would have been tolerable, but there were two other glaring problems with the audio version of the book:1. There is music that plays randomly throughout the story.  This was distracting and detracted from the story.  I understand using music to signal the end of a CD (I am listening to an audiobook that does just that), but this music was in the middle of chapters.  It played behind a few very important scenes, scenes that were somber and serious.  Uplifting, new age music with somber and serious scenes?  Not for me.  More problematic was how distracting it was for the students, who were asking why there was music playing rather than listening to the story.2. The narrator seemed to think Jonas was a whiny, petulant, snivelly boy.  In my multiple readings of the book, I found Jonas thoughtful, patient, clever, and calm.  He was not a whiner; he was not a complainer; he was not petulant.  At the end of the book, The Giver reveals a secret to Jonas that upsets him greatly.  I had to turn off the audio version because the way in which the narrator read Jonas\' part was absolutely ridiculous and not how the book even says.  Jonas is supposed to be sarcastic...the narrator made him whine.  Jonas is supposed to be passionately caring...the narrator made him whine.Again, this review is for the AUDIO version only.  The book itself is awesome.  I love it.  I am angry about the movie they\'re making because it\'s not going to represent the book.  I am similarly angry about this audiobook because it doesn\'t represent Jonas in a way I feel he -- and we, the readers -- deserve.
