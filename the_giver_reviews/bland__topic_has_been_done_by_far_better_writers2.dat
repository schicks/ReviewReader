If you look at the description of this book and the description of the other books by Lois Lowry, you see a repeating theme - the loner, the outsider and the society that doesn\'t understand. In this case, it is a bland world of super protected people that can not really experience anything including real pain, love, and death. Everything is decided by rules and the group. It is a little like 1984 except far more pleasant. One individual is select to bear the burden of memories. A new child is selected and is given memories. including memories of war, starvation, complete families, etc. What is puzzling and never really explained is that the community does not experience color - color of skin and color of fruit, flowers, water even hair. That makes no sense. Apparently color allows more choice than the community feels is safe. Something got left when that was being explained.Of course the hero finds a way to break free and help the community. What else would happen? Of course I am being cynical. In the hands of a less idealistic writer this could be a really good story, however as written it lacks a lot. I think it won all kinds of awards because adults think children should be reading this type of moralistic idealistic stuff. I can not imagine any child except those that are overprotected and idealistic reading this. It does not really challenge thinking about choices and consequences. Nor does it challenge thinking about rules and societal needs.
