I first read "The Giver" when I was in the 6th grade (I\'m now a senior in High School) and the book only gets better every time I read it.  I have read many other books concerning the issue of ideal and Utopian societies.  These books are very deep and often disturbing.  "The Giver" touches on these issues but in a very chilish and delicate manner which makes it perfect for young children to read.  It mildly exposes them to the idea that society cannot be perfect and that the more perfection a government strives for, the less privelaged its citizens become.  I can personally say that "The Giver" gave me my first real sense of pride in my country and the rights and liberties it grants me simply for living on its grounds.  The story also provoked my first thoughts of appreciation of life in general.  Although my senses of pride and appreciation have grown much more since the 6th grade, "The Giver" was a thought-provoking and inspirational introduction to the adult world I was soon to face.  It is, by far, one of my favorite novellas ever (and I have read many). I would highly reccommend it to anyone.
