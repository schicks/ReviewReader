If you like books that have no clear CONCLUSION, then this book is for you.  If you like books where the author (that would be the person who is suppoed to be WRITING the book - which would entail FINISHING the book) feels its ok to let YOU decide what happened to the characters at the end of her book, then this book is for you.  I am one of those people who believe that a book should have a begining and middle and an ending (CONCLUSION).  Call me crazy!  The book has such a great premise, only to be TOTALLY ruined by the ending (or non-ending).  Do not waste your time - there are so many other really good books out there to read.  Just not by Lois Lowry.
