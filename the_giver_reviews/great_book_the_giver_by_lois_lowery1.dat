...Jonas\'s is a twelve-year-old boy living in a perfect futuristic world. There is no fighting, no pain, and no color, everything is completely organized.  Everyone is assigned a role in the community at age twelve. Jonas is assigned to receive training from the giver. The giver alone holds all of the memories of the real pain and happiness of life before the governors started the community.  But when training begins, things start to get tough.  By putting his hands on Jonas\'s back, the giver can transmit memories. The memories can make Jonas actually feel the pain or live the happiness.  Jonas finds out that his father has been lying to him about a baby boy, Gabe, and Jonas is forced to take action. Even in a perfect world like Jonas is in, life can be full of nasty surprises!!! I loved this book.  Lois Lowry did a great job of describing all the memories, it was like I was there instead of Jonas.  I also liked this book because it was a page-turner. You would be surprised how often I said to my Mom, "just one more chapter, pleease?"  At the end of the chapter she always left you hanging, which I personally think is a very good technique.I\'d recommend this book to more experienced readers who like science fiction books.  The only reason I was a bit disappointed with it was the very last part.  It was one of those endings that the author left you to decide the ending, and I don\'t really like those types of endings.  But all in all The Giver was a splendid, fun book.
