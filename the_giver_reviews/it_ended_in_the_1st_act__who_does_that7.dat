Not sure how this won a Newbery.  It is incredibly well written but woefully incomplete.Lowry did a masterful job setting up a story, revealing the depth of shock the main character feels as a veil is removed from in front of his eyes.  It helps when he is forced to try to see the world through the eyes of those he loves before making a difficult decision.But then it seems the Lowry was bored or had a looming publish date.  The Giver hatches a hasty plot (a quick shock is exposed about the Giver\'s past that you want to know more about), and it seems like the book is over 10 pages later.For all of the fanfare, I was hoping for an Ender\'s Game or Hunger Games or Dune.  What I received was a book that was over when it was just beginning.What happened to the main charcter?  What happened to the town?  What happened to the friends Jonas cared about?
