The Giver was one of the most interesting books to read.  It was very easy to read, and I would really recommend it to people of all ages.  These people lived in a world where there were restrictions on practically everything.  Even left over food was to be recycled.  But for a community that was to be so perfect, well I\'ve got my own response.  When Jonas was picked to be the new reciever he was very scared because he really did not know what to think.  Jonas and the Giver developed a friendship that could last forever.  But I believe that the best thing that could ever happen to him was to just plain and simply leave his home.  But what really got to me was the fact of how they decieved others of what being released really meant.  The fact that they killed the lighter of the twins just because there could not be two of them was one of the most cruelest things yet.  But in a so called perfect society I believe things like that would happen every day.  It\'s just the only two people who knew what feelings where just couldn\'t take it anymore.  Jonas left and the Giver had been living ten years of grief because his only daughter Rosemary had wanted to be realeased.  So if you have an hour or so to spare this book would be a great one for you to read.  Or if you were interested in what you might think the future would be like in another 100 years I believe this would give you some insight.
