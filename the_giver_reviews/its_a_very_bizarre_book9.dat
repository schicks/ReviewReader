"THE GIVER" Author: Lois Lowry Report by: Shelton Amerman  In my own personal opinion, "THE GIVER", by Lois Lowry, is an  extremely bizarre book. It\'s a book about a future world. This world is  supposedly perfect; no crime, no poverty, no starvation, no war, no  prejudice, no overpopulation, no divorce, no pain, good educational system.  Children grow up learning different jobs, rules of the community, good  manners, and proper speech. When they reach the age of twelve( they  celebrate birthdays all at the same time), they are assigned a job that  fits with their abilities, if they want a spouse, they are assigned one, if  they want children, they are assigned one male and one female, no more.  When they are old, they go to a special facility. It\'s perfect; on the  surface. There is also no freedom, no privacy, no emotion, no color, no  music, no sunlight, no weather, no understanding of the past, no choice.  When someone gets to old, they are "released", if twins or an  extra child is born, they are "released"(releasing is what they  call killing).  The book focuses primarily on the experiences of a boy  called Jonas. When he turns twelve, he is selected for the most honored  position in the community, "Receiver of Memories" from the  "Giver of Memories". The position is one in which "The  Giver" gives memories of the past, both good and bad, to Jonas. Jonas  learns that the community is not the perfect place he once thought it was.  Then something happens that causes Jonas to do something drastic. At the  end he......well, you\'ll have to read the book to find out.  The book is  very well written, very descriptive and imaginative, But the ending leaves  you hanging. All in All, It\'s a good book.
