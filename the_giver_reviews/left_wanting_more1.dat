When I first read the summary for this novel, I thought it would be similar to George Orwell\'s 1984 or a piece of modern, post-apocalyptic science-fiction. The story had similar characteristics such as: a "Big-Brother" type government and a society jaded by post-traumatic-stress, but surprisingly the novel set itself apart from other books of this nature. I was pleasantly surprised with the suspense throughout the novel. As soon as I thought I could predict their next move, the characters took me by surprise. Jonas comes across as a happy, satisfied child who wants-for-nothing. Living with his father, mother and sister, Lily, they seem like a very normal family. As the story progresses you learn of his communities need for "sameness" and callousness. When he is presented with his job as "Receiver," he is honored that the elders chose him for such a highly-respected position. Although he doesn\'t know much about his assignment, Jonas is excited and eager to start his job. As the Giver starts to train him, the reader is on an emotional rollercoaster ride as they find Jonas\' position being less of an honor and more of a burden. Every truth he encounters leads him to a lie about his seemingly perfect community. Every emotional forbiddance becomes more of a temptation. The safety of sameness becomes a danger! Besides the beginning of the book being a little slow, I would definitely suggest this as a must-read! I was in high school when this book was published. It is unfortunate that this wasn\'t on our required summer reading list!
