Somehow, I missed this one growing up. I picked up the book because I saw a preview for the movie and I decided to give the book a try. I\'m only going to say a couple of things.1. As an adult reading this, it was too simplistic. This isn\'t an negative, only a warning to any adults who want to give this a try and have never ready it as children. This was written for children and it reads as such.2. Great, fantastic premise. Not original by today\'s standards, but since this book is, I believe 20 years old, certainly groundbreaking for the time. Relevant to any era I think.3. Lastly, there are some supernatural elements. They\'re subtle, to say the least, but you have to suspend belief in a couple of places (can\'t say more as I don\'t want to give any spoilers).I am trying to get my daughter to read this - while the reading level is a bit low for her I think she, like I did, will enjoy the premise and where the book takes you.
