I finished this, because it was so short, but I really didn\'t like it. The premise was somewhat interesting, but I never cared what happened to the main character, and I was disappointed by the lack of depth of the story. I know it\'s classified as a YA book, but I\'d put it in the elementary school level. Not on a par with, for example, Harry Potter books. More like a step above Henry &amp; Ribsy.
