The Giver by Lois Lowry combines aspects of fantasy, science fiction, and mystery genres.  While clearly a dystopian novel after the pattern of 1984 (and, I would assume, A Brave New World, but I haven\'t read that yet), this book also incorporates such fantasy/philosophical concepts as collective memory.Although much of what is happening is clearly explained later on, readers who like a little ambiguity will enjoy trying to interpret what Jonas means when he describes things from a worldview very different from our own.The ending leaves the reader confused and deflated, belonging more to the fantasy/philosophical parts of the book than the science fiction parts.  While Jonas seems happy in the end, one cannot figure out where he is, what will happen to him, or even if he\'s still alive.  Personally, I wanted something more concrete.However, it is a beautiful, enthralling, and tasteful tale for the fairly mature reader willing to contemplate the nature of love, sexuality (this part is mild), infanticide, suicide, history, paternalistic government, etc., without the "resistance is futile" hopelessness of adult dystopian novels.I loved it at 12.  I love it at 18.Can anyone tell me if the legend of the sanitation worker told by the children of Jonas\' community is an allusion to Anthem by Ayn Rand?
