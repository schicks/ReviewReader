"The Giver" is one of the most provocative and thoughtful books that has an intriguing story line as well. Right from the first sentences, readers meet Jonas, a 13 year old boy, who\'s thoughts and observations sound very natural and familiar, like somebody you already know and care for.Page by page, a new world that is set in some distant future unfolds with its "dangerous simplicity". The wrong and right is not spelled out in the beginning of the book, so the reader has a chance to follow Jonas and to see everything and to decide for themselves. Jonas observations add up to questions, and he starts to see everything a bit differently, he starts to question himself if everything around him is exactly as it seems.Further, the story flows into a beautiful climax - Jonas meets the Giver - a person who has an ability to "see beyond", the ability that Jonas himself has as well and was chosen to develop it further as Giver\'s student. The Giver "gives" Jonas all kind of feelings and memories that humanity has accumulated but denied to burden themselves with. Instead, it was up to one person to know all there is to know and to "shelter" everyone else from it. But Jonas knows too much now, and he decides to take action - something that no one have ever succeeded at in the community - he decides to flee in search of other, "real" way of living.The book ends at even more provoking and intense note. But Jonas knows the truth now, and he is free to choose for himself. He is free to feel all there is to feel - excitement and pain equally...Julia ShpakAuthor of "Power of Plentiful Wisdom".
