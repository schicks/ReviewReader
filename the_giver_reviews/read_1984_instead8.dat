Perhaps because it\'s so lauded I expected more. It\'s just a 1984, Brave New World, Farenheit 451, Animal Farm or Clockwork Orange for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they\'re giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Jonas isn\'t stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn\'t clear. Or I\'m just too dumb to read into things.  I would have liked more of a "fleshing out" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I\'ll buy anything -- just sell it to me.
