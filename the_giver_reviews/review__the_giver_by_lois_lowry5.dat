I have owned The Giver, a book by, Lois Lowry, since I won it in 8th grade (I\'m in 11th now). People always tokd me it was good, but for some reason I never actaully read it until this year. I\'m glad I did read it because it\'s fascinating. It was written for young adult readers (my sister read it in her 8th grade class), but I suggest it for people of all ages because it is entertaining and thought provoking. The book is set in a community where everyone goes through the same routines, and feels no emotions. The main character is a young, teenage boy. The boy is chosen to be the next Giver (you\'ll have to read the book to find out what that means) which is when the reader becomes more aware of the restrictive communtity that the boy lives in. The book has a fast paced plot, but is not a thriller. It isn\'t a mystery either, but the reader is given information bit by bit until they realize the dull, restrictive the boy used to lead. I think the book has an underlying commentary about the importance of history in a societym and the dangers of extreme comformity. It\'s an interesting, quick read for adults, and fast paced and entertaining enough for younger children. I think anyone who hasn\'t read this yet should definitely give it a try.
