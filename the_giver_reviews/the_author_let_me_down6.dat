Since this book is so critically acclaimed it is impossible to not know about it. I pushed off reading it for centuries. Then I saw the movie trailer and I thought "why not? I enjoy reading books on utopian society\'s" so I searched it and saw the incredible reviews so again I thought "why not?" The author did a really good job in the beginning. Great story line! The book was whimsical but twisted. Then the end came and I was completely let down. Authors enjoy leaving readers hanging and wanting more but she robbed us. She left so many questions and such an uneasiness. I looked frantically for a sequel but nothing. Her other books are attempts at recreating the giver. Extremely let down. Read at your own risk.
