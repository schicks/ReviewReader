This is a wonderful book showing what possibly may happen in the future.  Lois Lowry opens the readers\' eyes to the possibilities that life may not always be as we know it now.  Jonas, the main character, is an apprehensive  eleven year old at the beginning of this book.  He turns into a very wise,  knowledgable twelve-year-old.  The Giver and Jonas live in a dull community  without individualism, colors or any change at all (in weather, land,  people, etc.).  Jonas and the Giver are the only people in their community  who have feelings and hold the memories (of pain and pleasure) of the past.  To see how Jonas tries to save the memories of the past, read this  thought-provoking story by Lois Lowry!
