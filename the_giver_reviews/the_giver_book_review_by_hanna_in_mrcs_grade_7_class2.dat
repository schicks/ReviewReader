I am not usually very interested in science - fiction books, but I\'d have to say this book, "The Giver", which is both science - fiction and fantasy, without a doubt, is one of the best books I\'ve ever read.  I would describe this book as very unique and unusual.  "The Giver" will lead the reader to a whole new world.  This utopian society that the author had created is seen through the eyes of the main character, Jonas.  This society that Jonas is living in has no emotional or physical pain, crime, suffering or disease.  It is where everything is perfect except for the part that there is no colour and no freedom of choice, and even `love\'.  All these things were left out of the community because of the problems all these things caused in the world of the past.  When Jonas turns twelve, just like everyone else, he receives a job selected by the elders but unlike the usual, Jonas is singled out and is selected to be the Receiver of Memory.  He gets special training from the Giver.  The Giver alone holds the memories of the truth, pain, and pleasure of life.  It is his job to pass these memories to Jonas.  Now it is time for Jonas to receive the truth.  There is no way out.  This book, "The Giver", has a very mysterious and puzzling ending that keeps the reader pondering.  The ending is left to the imagination of the reader.  This book will make you think.  It will make you actually look at the world you are living in.  If I had the chance to edit some parts of the book, I wouldn\'t have anything to change because this book is perfect just the way it is.  It is a great book and I would rate it 4.5 out of 5.  It is very inspiring and a book that you will not regret reading.
