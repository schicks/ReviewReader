I wanted to like this book much more than I actually did.  I pushed through each chapter eager to learn more about Jonas, Giver, the community and some unanswered questions.  Then all of a sudden, Giver is helping Jonas leave the community and the book ends with him and Gabriel in the snow....????  Did I miss something? And what\'s up with that red sled (from a memory) showing up at the top of the same hill ?.I do like books that make you think, ponder and then later wonder, "what ever happened to ....or, I wonder why...."  but I was just irritated that the Giver abruptly transitioned and then ended with the rest of the story never told and questions left unanswered. No continuation and no real sequel.  One more chapter maybe? What happened to Jonas between the snow scene in the Giver and him showing up as Leader in the Messenger???  What about Gabe???  I cared about these people and then.....nothing.I was left with strange feelings after finishing this book.....like, that feeling you get when you reach out to shake someones hand and they don\'t reciprocate, but rather leave you hanging.  Or, being invited to dinner then ignored and expected to pick up the tab.  This book had so much more potential.  The author invited us to a great party and somewhere around 11:30, when things were getting good, she up and goes to bed.This was a bittersweet book, (I\'ll admit it more sweet than bitter, ) that left a lingering residue that I wish a Receiver could take from me.  The decisions the author made to move the characters from Sameness into Nothingness while I wasn\'t looking was most bothersome.  Did she become bored with her own characters?  Seems like we were all abandoned on this journey.  I think it only proper to be asked for forgiveness for this rudeness.
