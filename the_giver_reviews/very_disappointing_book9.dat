I agree with most of the criticisms of the one-star, two-star, and three-star reviews. I originally bought the series quartet; but I doubt that I will ever read the last three books. There is little rationale for how a society might develop (and how long it would take to do so) a strong caste culture, loss of important personal choices, emotionless killing of misfits, an almost uniform disappearance of the physical sense of color, and loss of cultural memory (except for the Giver). Yet, having told us these things are so, the author makes it clear that society still maintains military capability. When Jonas asks about love, there\'s a widely known process for resisting and squelching his interest. Why hasn\'t "love" disappeared as personal choice and color perception and cultural memory have disappeared? I find little rationale for the function and ability of the Giver in the postulated society. I find little rationale for the premise that a memory disappears from the Giver after he reveals it to his successor. There are other problems for me with this book, but suffice it to say that I was disappointed with The Giver and found little story-telling value in it.
