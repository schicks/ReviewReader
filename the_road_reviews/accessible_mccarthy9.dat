I finished this book in the kitchen in a rush, in tears.  I am a father. The relationship the father and the son have in the book is pure and eternal.  Yes, the world in which they are attempting to survive is bleak, but they persist.  There is much to enjoy in this book, from the relentlessness of McCarthy\'s imagery to simply guessing where in America they might exactly be.  Rewarding read.
