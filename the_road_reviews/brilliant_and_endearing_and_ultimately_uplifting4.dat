THE ROAD is a tremendous achievement, multi-layered, yet with enough surface story to attract mainstream readers. It resonates with classic allusions, simple parables, endearing moments, aphorisms, even some old testament language a la BLOOD MERIDIAN. In fact all of McCarthy\'s earlier novels are echoed here.As with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, all of the doomsday clocks, both personal and communal, stop at 1:17, a reference to John 1:17 in the Book of Revelations.  As with his previous novel, McCarthy names love as the one value worth living for in this vale of tears, the last thing to go.Comic relief is provided in the form of Ely, the only named character in the book.  Readers will have to judge for themselves whether they think that Ely is the prophet Elijah, Christ in ragged disguise, Buddha on the Road, or just a funny old man who speaks in koans.THE ROAD will remind some of Jose Saramago\'s BLINDNESS, which won the Nobel Prize for that deserving author.  Others will liken the beautiful writing to the very best of Ernest Hemingway--with the understatement one finds in BIG, TWO-HEARTED RIVER and THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.Cliched? Not in this reader\'s eyes. Of course the great themes here have been rendered before in the classics, and books are made of books. I immediately recognized Homer\'s ghosts of hades in here, pointing and pleading and crying for help.What is the quote in THE ROAD on page 110?  "Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it."  Which resonates to a quote from Marcus Aurielius, saying that a man ought to live his life as if borrowed, and that he ought to be prepared at any time to give it back, saying--here, I thank you for this life which I have had in my possession.I found it uplifting.  A testament to the condition of humanity and the nature of death and the riddle of existence. Universal themes, the greatest themes in our literature.
