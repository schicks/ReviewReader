To say that The Road is a rather dark book would be quite the understatement....As far as dystopian literature goes, this is quite a step.The story of a father and his son, walking to the sea through a ravaged, cold and grey world, hoping to somehow, find a better place, doesn\'t leave much space for a happy ending. Bleak is truly bleak here, not a lot of silver linings!And yet...and yet, this is a beautiful book.The writing is fantastic, for starter. The style, with short and descriptive sentences, carries the story to perfection. It also has a poetic quality that softens what is said/described and gives it another dimension.The real beauty of the novel isn\'t on the outside though, but resides inside, in the incredible bond uniting father and son, a love so deep and unconditional that it seems to erase age gap and life experience, to only focus on their desire to care for each other. This love and concomitant sense of humanity stripped to its essence, manage to give sense and meaning to their otherwise hopeless journey.On a deeper level, it also seems to invite us to reflect on what makes a life meaningful: beyond a primal survival instinct, what makes life worth living even when there is no hope in sight? The Road\'s answer is that, ultimately, what matters isn\'t "what" makes your life, but "how" you choose to live that "what"...
