What a disappointing experience. Although I actually read the book through (even though I wanted to toss it in the trash) I cannot give it a good review. The style is, in my view, an example of complete absence of the artistry of writing fiction. In fact, the book needed a good editing. The incomplete sentences, mixed-up direct objects, pitiful descriptions ("the waterfall fell") and use of uncommon words repeatedly destroyed the flow of the prose. The story was repetitive and moved forward in spurts, used many contrivances to keep the plot moving, and was unutterably dismal. headed off to the second-hand bookstore, this book is not a keeper.
