i don\'t often post reviews of books on here, but the negative digs at this master work prompted me to.  They were all written by thin skinned cowards who are better suited to sticking with doctor seuss rather than something that might make their bubbly little hearts feel a touch of sadness.  Kafka could take a good many cues from Mr McCarthy on writing stories in a bleak tone rich with despair that still leaves the reader with a deeper understanding of the strengths of the human spirit and ones will to continue to exist while facing endless oblivion.  I wish I could give this more stars, and slap each talentless, blind hack who thought that their negative opinion was worth expressing until they cut their deluded nonsense and kept their useless mouths shut.
