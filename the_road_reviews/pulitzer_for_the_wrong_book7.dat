First, I will say that The Road is worth reading; it is a good book. However, it is not the masterpiece so many are proclaiming it to be; and, too, it is not Mr. McCarthy\'s best novel (that would be Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West).I\'ve always admired Mr. McCarthy for his minimalist prose, intriguing characters, and stunning insights into the more darker side of the human condition. It\'s rare for novelists to mine such seemingly malefic territory and draw from it some kind of beauty or understanding. (Joyce Carol Oates is another of those rare novelists that springs instantly to mind; she, like Mr. McCarthy, is not afraid to shine a raw light onto aspects of human nature most other novelists would just as soon leave in the dark.)While I\'ve not read all of Mr. McCarthy\'s novels, I\'ve read enough to know that I admire much of his work. For years, he has been regarded as one of America\'s greatest writers; indeed, the heir apparent to Faulkner and Hemingway. Anyone who has read Child of God, The Orchard Keeper, Blood Meridian, Outer Dark, or Suttree would, I think, be hard pressed to deny such a mantle to Mr. McCarthy.Whenever a new novel written by Mr. McCarthy is released, I purchase it on its sale date. I had read some early reviews of The Road and was eagerly anticipating its release. And though it is a novel that one may read quickly, I chose instead to take my time, lingering over the prose. I found myself moved by the novel; however, as it went on, I became somewhat disheartened. It became sadly repetitive and its dialogue so vague as to be almost banal. Not something I\'d encountered in Mr. McCarthy\'s work before. What I felt I was reading was in fact not a novel, but rather the notes for a novel or a screenplay that had yet to actually be written.The plot has been covered numerous times in other reviews; therefore, I will not repeat it here. What I will say is this: In a world that has grown so savage, and so many of its surviving humans so vicious, it seemed odd to me that the main characters ("the good guys," as they describe themselves) maneuvered through the dangerous landscape as easily as they did. For the first time, I felt as if Mr. McCarthy were playing "the manipulative writer" rather than "the chronicler of specific lives."In other words, the seams showed; there was no moment when I truly feared for the man and the boy, for Mr. McCarthy never relented in letting them get away from "the bad guys." Like the narrative description, this element persisted to a point in which I was more or less certain that I would not find myself surprised by a change of course. And it just didn\'t wash. To create such an ugly, dangerous, desperate world and then to let the main characters make it through that world more or less unscathed by the external evils -- it seemed more gimmick than story.The novel\'s saving grace, however, is to be found in the closing pages. Mr. McCarthy comes alive here -- a little too late -- and the manner in which he chooses to end the novel is quite moving. The problem, of course, is that one has to slog through quite a bit of ash and mundane repetition to reach said point.When I finished the novel, I wondered if perhaps I\'d missed something. It\'s not a book I wouldn\'t recommend (Mr. McCarthy is a stunning writer, whether one reads his better works or his lesser ones), but it is one for which I felt bewilderment when I learned that it had won the Pulitzer Prize. Perhaps the board bent and decided to give Mr. McCarthy the award after years of ignoring his other -- better and more deserving -- novels (see Blood Meridian). It rather cheapened the awards for me, especially considering the other novels released last year that were better than The Road (The Echo Maker, Richard Powers; Everyman, Philip Roth; The Lay of the Land, Richard Ford -- to name a few).Of the Pulitzer finalists, however, Richard Powers\'s The Echo Maker was definitely the more deserving of said literary accolade. Like many great novels (Beloved, Gravity\'s Rainbow, Gilead, The Known World, The Color Purple), it teaches one how to read it. Its characters are fully human; its narrative gripping and gorgeously rendered; its themes stunning in both their beauty and complexity; and its investigation of American life -- in the new millenium and post-911 -- so sharp and clarified that I often had to set aside the book and regard my own similar feelings to such a dark and turbulent time. It\'s what the best novels do: remind us who we are, from what we come, and perhaps offer us a glimpse of where we may be headed.I might well have said the same about The Road, but it never struck me as being so fully realized as to stir such thoughts. It didn\'t tell me anything new that other post-apocalyptic fiction hadn\'t already touched and investigated. It seemed more like poetry crossed with the classic conventions of the road novel and sprinkled here and there with cryptic doses of George A. Romero.A good book, but not one deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. Sadly, in the future, Mr. McCarthy will be regarded as "the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of The Road," when rather the accolade would better and more honestly read: "the Pulitzer Prize-Winning author of Blood Meridian."Somewhere, in stripping down his prose as to make it skeletally spartan, Mr. McCarthy forgot -- as he didn\'t in other novels -- how to tell a full story about real human beings caught in the grip of real and extraordinary circumstances.I was moved, but I was not convinced. And that saddens me, for Mr. McCarthy has been a writer whom I\'ve admired and respected for a good many years.Were he to win literature\'s highest accolade, it would have been better that he won for a novel worthy of the prize.It rather reminds me of this year\'s Academy Awards, during which one of America\'s greatest filmmakers won awards for a film that, while good, was certainly not his best -- and perhaps because the voting membership, in trying to assuage past failures, felt that a consolation prize was better than no prize at all.So, if one wishes to read and see the best of last year, then pick up Richard Powers\'s The Echo Maker, then walk over to the DVD section and pick out Alfonso Cuaron\'s Children of Men (a film whose themes and milieu seem similar to those presented in Mr. McCarthy\'s The Road, only more fully and honestly).
