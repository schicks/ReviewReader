In 1982, as a lark, to keep me away from bad habits, I undertook reading and/or rereading everything William Faulkner had written. Having had an excellent professor in college who had guided me through a half dozen of the books  I prepared myself with a brand new paperback dictionary. I used it often and after 6 months it was in pieces and I could say I read all of Faulkner for fun. When I was finished I lamented there was no more Faulkner to read. Then in the early \'90\'s someone steered me to McCarthy. I read "..Pretty Horses..." first and then moved through the early catalog dictionary in hand. I had a blast. I was reading an author who loved words and created images that emotively seemed similar to Faulkner. Once Faulkner called himself a failed poet as he used too many words to describe a thing. As McCarthy\'s body of work has grown so as his efficient writing style. "No Country..." hit me like few other books and I did something I hadn\'t done since childhood. After reading it I turned around and read it again, twice. Since then I\'ve read it two more times.Now "The Road"" arrives and with images that have been seared into my skull as I read the book in a single sitting.As a father of a young son I was moved by the devotion of the man to the boy. What do you tell someone who knows only what is? Several earlier reviews mention wishing to know what caused the world to be in the shape that it is. I think we aren\'t informed because knowing that would not change the world as it is for the man and boy. In "No Country..." several key scenes that would have most probably been filled with action and blood were left not described for the same reason I think. The reality of the world that is now would not be changed by the knowing.I am reminded of a quote from Bishop Butler. "All things are, what they are, and not another thing."Cormac McCarthy has written a book about a man and a boy in a world we can neither honestly imagine or explain. It is a story of profound love and a perverted hope of victory for the "good guys." I cannot escape the images that are now absorbed into my thinking and reality. You should buy and read this book."The finger pointing at the moon is not the moon."
