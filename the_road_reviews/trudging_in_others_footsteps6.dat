Quite frankly, I found this book disappointing.  McCarthy is an indisputably good novelist, but this seemed phoned in.Some have praised its style as spare, terse, in keeping with its subject and tone. They make a similar argument to explain the fact that the plot basically starts nowhere particular, ends nowhere particular and doesn\'t traverse anything particularly interesting en route.  Well, of course!  It\'s supposed to be, like, existential!This sort of analysis makes for interesting reviews.  But I, the reader, see the flip side.  The narrative lacks richness, and my take is that this mirrors a simple lack of engagement on McCarthy\'s part rather than being a deliberate stylistic reflection of the post-apocalyptic world it\'s intended to evoke.Perhaps I\'ve been spoiled by a youthful interest in SF/fantasy that exposed me to quite a few stories in this genre, by authors from Arthur C. Clarke to the considerably less well-known Philip Wylie and Roshwald Mordecai.  "The Road" breaks no new ground and these lesser-known writers commendably invested the effort to craft their stories with considerably greater care.  My recommendation for a more inventively conceived and better realized post-apocalypse tale still remains Walter M. Miller\'s classic "A Canticle for Leibowitz".
