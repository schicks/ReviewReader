I honestly don\'t know why so many people are saying "Wow, this is so depressing." Is a post-apocalyptic novel supposed to be a happy and cheery read with butterflies and rainbows and daisies? I don\'t think so.Now for the book...flawless beauty. The Road is a very emotional tale about a father and his son after the apocalypse (it is never explained what happened, though that adds to the mysteriousness and gives the book an amount of depth.) This was my first Cormac McCarthy book, but it surely will not be my last. He deserved to win the Pulitzer Prize.
