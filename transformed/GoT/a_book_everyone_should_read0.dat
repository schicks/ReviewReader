26Simply the best book Proper_Noun read in Proper_Noun long time. I actually held off reading Proper_Noun book when it first came out, thinking that the hype was just that: hype. At the time I couldn\'t believe that some new book could be better than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was wrong. I bought the Proper_Noun of Thrones when the second book (Clash of Proper_Noun came out in paperback, and after 100 pages I knew why everyone who reads Proper_Noun book loves it. Martin effortlessly gives you Proper_Noun dozen characters that you may not love (some are revolting), but you understand them. No character is "good" or "bad;" they are simply people, with private motivations, reasons, and prejudices. Part of what makes these books so great is that the characters are not flawless. Some likeable characters are blinded by thier pasts, or even thier sense of honor.Another thing about Proper_Noun book that is refreshing is the lack of Proper_Noun Not that the world is without any, it takes Proper_Noun major backseat in the plot. Many stories today have the "magic-user" as some kind of god-on-earth, and rely on him/her to save the world by some miraculous display of magic that only they can perform. This book has more to do with ruthless politicking than Proper_Noun wrap it up, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Not to lessen the greatness of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or any of the others...This series is on Proper_Noun different level. I know that as you read Proper_Noun many of you\'re probably sceptical, like I was. Just try Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and at worst you\'ll be out Proper_Noun whooping 7.50. More likely, you will be floored by Proper_Noun unique book.
