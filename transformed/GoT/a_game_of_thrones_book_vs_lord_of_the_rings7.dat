10I am comparing this book to the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun because it has been put in the same genre by professional critics.Yes, the book is enthralling, but that doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t deserve criticism. The first book, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is very good. But after that the rest of the books seemed to steadily decline into incoherency, mush and absolute ridiculous plot lines.I get it. The good guys, who aren\'t entirely good, get killed off, and the bad guys have some good, and no one really wins. There is Proper_Noun lot of porn, rape, violence, such descriptive violence it is almost Proper_Noun porn in itself, and it is unpredictable, but it gets to be Proper_Noun torture to read.Behind Proper_Noun good book is always motivation. What really was Proper_Noun motivation?Tolkien\'s characters may be heroes, and good does prevail, after terrible, seemingly insurmountable troubles. But Proper_Noun aim, it would seem, was to promote faith that good will prevail as long as those pursuing it don\'t give up the battle against greed and weakness. Also, when you read Tolkien, you feel most of the characters are worthy of saving.The only ones I felt worthy of being saved in Proper_Noun books were the direwolves, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The rest: well, the others take them! (Even Proper_Noun seemed to like killing too much).Sorry, I think I could have struggled through these very detailed, complex plots if there wasn\'t such utter immorality and cruelty in it. It not only got hard to stomach all that rape, but heads being chopped off willy nilly, eyes gauged out. There\'s just too much of it in this book for my taste.I normally like to escape the ugliness of the world by reading, this just amplifies it even more.
