10This Proper_Noun review for the box set of the first four books in the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun saga. I think it\'s appropriate here because there are no spoilers and if it makes you want to read the first book, you can save Proper_Noun nice piece of change by ordering the box set. Believe me, once you\'ve read the first book, you will want the others.Here\'s the briefest possible plot summary of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to date (Volumes 1-4): Five factions are at war for the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and control of the continent of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun sixth force is gathering power in the Proper_Noun across the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun while ultimate Proper_Noun lurks in the Proper_Noun beyond the Proper_Noun I don\'t intend to tell you any more of the story. To do so would be Proper_Noun grave disservice. It would ruin the shocks and surprises that await the reader. To borrow the tag line for the movie Proper_Noun Proper_Noun you are not prepared. No more story, but I do have more to say.A reviewer for Proper_Noun magazine dubbed Proper_Noun "the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It makes me wonder if this reviewer has ever read The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun You\'d be hard pressed to find two more different Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series. I\'d say that any child who is old enough to want to read Proper_Noun should do so. That\'s not the case with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It\'s far too grim and gritty, far too bloody, and far too sexually explicit. Another difference is plotting. Once you get into Proper_Noun you can pretty much know where the story is going to go. There may be Proper_Noun few bumps in the road, but it\'s pretty predictable. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is completely unpredictable. While you\'re reading, you may think you know where the story is headed. Trust me, you\'ll be wrong. Proper_Noun third difference is tone. Proper_Noun was written from the perspective of Proper_Noun neutral observer. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is written from the point of view of the characters experiencing the events of the story. (In fact none of these books have chapters. Each section is labeled with the name of the Proper_Noun character.) As Proper_Noun consequence, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun struck an emotional chord with me (multiple ones actually) that I never felt with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was like watching Proper_Noun fun fantasy movie. Despite its dragons, sorcery, and wights (reanimated corpses),its giants and wargs Proper_Noun changers) Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems very real. It\'s like you are living the story. Proper_Noun final difference: Proper_Noun is clearly Proper_Noun story of Proper_Noun vs Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun may be able to corrupt Proper_Noun Proper_Noun person, but basically there is no trouble telling which side Proper_Noun character fits on. Proper_Noun of the many things I like about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is its moral ambiguity. Each of the six factions has Proper_Noun legitimate claim to the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun least by its own reasoning). Its true that Proper_Noun side seems more noble than the rest and another is nastier but men on the "good" side commit atrocities every bit as heinous as those on the Proper_Noun side. Even the noblest character in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has warts (marital infidelity) and some of the Proper_Noun guys" turn out to be sympathetic characters.I must confess that I have never been fond of overly long novels. I suppose then that I should explain why I ordered this box set sight unseen. I had read the two prequel graphic novels, The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun published by Proper_Noun (based on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin\'s novellas). I liked both but not enough to buy these megabooks. Then I was blown away by the first episode of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun series. That did it for me and Proper_Noun so glad that it did. I\'ve just spent Proper_Noun big chunk of the last month or so of my life immersed in this fantastic world and loved every minute of it. Four books back-to-back-to-back-to-back, 3882 pages without Proper_Noun break (not counting the appendices). I\'ve never done anything like that before and am unlikely ever to do it again. For me that pretty much defines "page-turner". Proper_Noun is an excellent plotter. He uses the same technique Proper_Noun Abrams used with Proper_Noun Every Proper_Noun you get to Proper_Noun point where you\'ve just got to see what happens next, he switches scenes. I could almost hear the sound that indicated Proper_Noun scene change in Proper_Noun BRrruuUPP. Oh,no, don\'t stop now. Not now!I don\'t give out 5-star ratings easily. For me 5-stars means the work is exceptional. If ever there was Proper_Noun 5-star series this is it. (I should add that Volume 4 is not quite as Proper_Noun as the previous three books, but that\'s because my two favorite characters, Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun do not appear in it. That will be remedied next month when Volume 5 comes out. I can\'t wait.) If Proper_Noun maintains the quality of the remaining volumes, this series will truly be Proper_Noun monumental achievement.
