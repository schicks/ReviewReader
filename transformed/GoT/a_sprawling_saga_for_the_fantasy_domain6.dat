56These books do bring in a few postmoderm mechanisms to the fantasy domain. Evil is complex, people can change. Characters are not static. The story is told from multiple perspectives. So if you avoid other fiction to focus on fantasy these might be interesting to you. However, it is not particularly innovative.However, the writing in and of itself can be better compared to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun than Proper_Noun While not all dawns are rosy, the terrains are over-stated and the descriptions sometimes laughable. If you can read, "Her loins ached from his lovemaking." without laughing at the sheer badness of that prose, then the turbid nature of the writing will not trouble you.If you enjoy sprawling sagas of passion and revenge, then this is for you. For me, it seems like an intersection of the modern gothic and fantasy. If you like dramatic sprawling sagas with revenge of the son and passionate trysts you will like this.I experienced it as bad historical fiction with a little magic thrown in. I do enjoy historical fiction and found this rather tedious. However, it was not so horribly tedious that I did not finish it. It is a good book for a long airplane ride, where you might get interrupted alot and don\'t need to concentrate.The reason I enjoy fantasy is that it can explore underlying issues and examine different social structures. There is nothing interesting here. If lesbian bondage is your thing, then buy better fiction. If history is your thing, buy good historical fiction. If fantasy is what you love for its potential to explore the larger possibilities of power, good and evil, and social change, then buy better fantasy.
