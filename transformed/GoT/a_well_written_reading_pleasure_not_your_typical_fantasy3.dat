15I purchased the hardcover of this book two years ago. It has collected dust until last Proper_Noun 10 Proper_Noun Eight days and 674 pages later; I find myself in awe of Proper_Noun work Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun His characters come alive in this tale- trilogy of power, corruption, lies, deceit, love, honor, valor etc.. You will find yourself cheering for any given character in one breath and forty pages later hating or despising that same character. The book and characters are Proper_Noun predicatable..a refreshing change I feverently welcome. Trust me when I say this book is more than just a fantasy novel. Mr. Martin has set a standard that will henceforth separate the pretenders from the contenders of literary genuis in this genre. I\'ve read Proper_Noun and many others but in my opinion Proper_Noun Martin and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at the top of their craft in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I can hardly wait to start Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun tonight; because now I realize the truth... "Winter is Proper_Noun and when it arrives, it wont be something nice :-). I hope my words have helped sway you to partake in this reading treasure.
