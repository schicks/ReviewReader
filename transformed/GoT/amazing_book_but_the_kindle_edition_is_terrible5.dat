8I won\'t review the content of this book since there are already so many good reviews. Needless to say I love this book!This is a review specifically of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of this book is Proper_Noun of errors. There are MANY typos and misspellings. For instance Proper_Noun is spelled Proper_Noun Proper_Noun looks a Proper_Noun like m). Obviously to make the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a copy of the book was scanned and the scanning failed in a Proper_Noun of places.Throughout the book you will find misplaced parentheses: in the middle of some words or sentences.I don\'t really want to enumerate every error so let\'s just say there are just too many errors to make reading this on the Proper_Noun enjoyable. Let this be a warning!
