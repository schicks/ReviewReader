65Game of Thrones is to books what Proper_Noun is to television series. George Proper_Noun Proper_Noun day job is TV writer. He begins by writing three books that really suck you in. You will become very attached to all of the many characters. After that, be warned: the story does not resolve. You will get a dream sequence when you want plot resolution. You will get three new characters and their back story when what you want desperately to know what happens to the character you just read a thousand pages about. Just because half of one of the first books is spent on a character central to the plot does not mean you will ever find out what happens to that character. On the other hand, characters you don\'t care about at all because they have no bearing on the past or future plot will get 5 chapters. Some characters just disappear.My husband and I watched six seasons of Proper_Noun It nearly gave me high blood pressure that the events of the first three seasons had nothing to do with the second three. I wanted to pull my hair out when the plot lines that drew me in were never revisited. I wanted to scream when a new character was introduced instead of seeing an existing characters story to it\'s end. My husband did not seem to care as much and was happy with the "they were dead all along" ending.I wish I had known going in that this was a tv show sort of a book. The story will get you to tune and watch the next season. But, if you are a reader who likes a whole story, don\'t bother. By book 4, you will just be frustrated and angry.
