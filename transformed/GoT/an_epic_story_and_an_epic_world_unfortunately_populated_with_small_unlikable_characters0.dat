4Welcome to the Continent of Proper_Noun where noble houses maneuver for control of the seat of power known as the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Follow Proper_Noun myriad of characters from competing factions as their fortunes rise and fall. All the while, mysterious forces grow to threaten the rule and lives of all the competitors in the deadly Proper_Noun of thrones.Sounds rather exciting. Given the popularity of the books and Proper_Noun series, most believe that it is. I can\'t help but dissent. As Proper_Noun lifelong fan of the fantasy genre (especially epic fantasy) I held high hopes for the wildly popular Proper_Noun Song of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series. The first Proper_Noun left me underwhelmed, but I persisted through the second in hopes that it would catch my interest. Alas, it did not.One failing of the Proper_Noun is the planning and pacing which would have Proper_Noun Proper_Noun rolling his eyes and muttering "get on with it." The very intriguing promise in the prologue of Proper_Noun 1 is promptly placed on the the back burner and never heard from again through the next two books (1500 pages). One of the primary story threads (Daenerys) begins and remains literally Proper_Noun thousand miles away from interacting with any of the other characters in through two books. But that is Proper_Noun quibble. The major problem lies elsewhere.Whereas traditional fantasy tends to have clearly defined lines of good and evil, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has instead set out to create Proper_Noun more realistic setting for his epic to take place. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun would be categorized as Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun fantasy. Meaning the heroes aren\'t all that heroic, the good guys aren\'t terribly good, happy endings need not apply, and if an ugly fate awaits Proper_Noun character then, by the gods, they get it and then some. While this in itself is not Proper_Noun problem, this is the origin of what truly goes wrong with the series, in my opinion. While Proper_Noun set out to create "realistic" fantasy characters by stripping traditional characters of their halos and imbuing them with moral failings in order to make them more believable and relate-able, instead what he accomplished is create an entire world populated with characters that fall into one of two categories: vicious, nasty, unlikable people who can\'t die soon enough, and Proper_Noun precious few with some decency who inevitably have some character trait Proper_Noun stupidity, or what have you) that makes them easy prey to the former category, Proper_Noun being the lone exception. "Oh, the last guy in charge was Proper_Noun backstabbing, raping, murdering sociopath? Well meet the new guy in charge: Proper_Noun backstabbing, raping, murdering sociopath with Proper_Noun different sigil." Eventually the entire story collapses under the weight of the realization that there is no such thing as Proper_Noun society which can exist where the preponderance of the population feels not Proper_Noun shred of moral compunction about butchering anyone and everyone they feel like at any time. It\'s not more realistic than the simplistic fantasy where the good guys can escape any danger and have hearts of solid gold. It\'s just as unrealistic, just in Proper_Noun different direction.But it is worse than that. All suspense and surprises are nullified in such Proper_Noun world. Proper_Noun noble stabbing another noble in the back is only shocking when honor is the generally accepted norm. When every character is (correctly) seen to be Proper_Noun ruthless back-stabber-in-waiting all plot twists involving betrayals cease to be dramatic. This is the tightrope Proper_Noun Proper_Noun walks. Give characters Proper_Noun side of foibles, failings, and flaws and they become more substantive, understandable, and real. Have characters drink too deeply at the well of "grit" and you wind up with Proper_Noun cast of amoral, muck-covered, thugs knifing holes in each other while the audience, rather than feeling empathy toward any, nods in approval then wants to back away and find somewhere to wash their hands.By the end of Proper_Noun 2, reading was chore. I wanted to finish because Proper_Noun Proper_Noun completionist, not because I actually cared about what happens to the characters. The end of Proper_Noun 2 culminates in Proper_Noun enormous battle--where I found myself rooting for every side to annihilate the others so what\'s left of the populace could live in peace. Failing that, Proper_Noun natural disaster such as Proper_Noun giant crack in the earth opening up and swallowing the lot of them whole would have been Proper_Noun satisfactory resolution for me.The emotional payoff for most novels comes in the form of Proper_Noun protagonist overcoming long odds and hardship to achieve some desired end. The payoff in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is to wait for the each despicable character to get their comeuppance. It is Proper_Noun payoff that holds no appeal to me.
