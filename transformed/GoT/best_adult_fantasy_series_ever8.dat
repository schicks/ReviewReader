7I have scanned some of the negative reviews of this book and it seems the common thread is shock over the adult content of the writing. Either that or outrage over the lack of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun element. It should be known that this book and this series is not G-rated Proper_Noun Nor is this series Proper_Noun rambling fantasy epic where everyone has special powers a\' la Proper_Noun this book and subsequent series happens to be is some of the best writing in the fantasy genre I have ever read. I have been reading fantasy for over 2 decades now and have never become so engrossed in any series as I have this one. True, I was Proper_Noun little put off at first by the lack of the Proper_Noun element - I didn\'t expect Proper_Noun historically based fiction novel to hold my attention - but it did, and the further on in the series you go, the more Proper_Noun comes into play.I read the Proper_Noun series up until Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and enjoyed the first 6 books or so but eventually realized that the story was going nowhere. After reading Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and the subsequent novels I finally grasped what good writing actually is. There are no cliche\' characters in Proper_Noun and no hokey actions like Proper_Noun "pulling her braid" in anger. Every major character is fully fleshed out and quite believable. The actions and reactions that lead to conflict are intelligent and understandable. The "adult" content is not over-the-top and only adds to the immersion and believability of the world that Proper_Noun created.Admittedly, the series starts out Proper_Noun little slowly with this book but keep on reading and you will be glad you did. The plot twists Proper_Noun throws out are sometimes saddening and sometimes uplifting but when you finish Proper_Noun book you feel as if you lived it. This is by no means Proper_Noun feel good fantasy series where the good guy always wins and no one gets hurt. This is Proper_Noun novel that describes what Proper_Noun medevil world must really be like if thrown into conflict with unknown forces as well as other Proper_Noun could go on and on about how well written and engaging this series is but you will just have to learn for yourself. If you are looking for Proper_Noun fantasy series that will keep you yearning for the next book and if you really want to see what quality writing is like, I recommend starting with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun
