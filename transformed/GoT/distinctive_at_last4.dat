38While Proper_Noun two released books share many elements with earlier fantasy epics, one element stands out: There are no real heroes, just as there are no real villians. The characters that the reader empathizes with tend to say more about the _reader_ than the book itself. More importantly, so far Proper_Noun has only lightly engaged in the practice that eventually ruins so many other good fantasy epics: turning main characters into Proper_Noun I do not necessarily mean this literally, although that can be the case, but the very nature of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems to require an ever-increasing series of hurdles, each growing more intimidating and bizarre, in order to hold the reader\'s interest. One clear example is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun character, introduced in \'The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Initially a slowly-aging knight returned from abroad to save his queen, four books later Proper_Noun is running around with a half-dozen Proper_Noun and using equipment that could easily allow him to destroy the planet itself. Yawn. Contrast, for example, The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun where the heroes are lowly Proper_Noun who desire only to (and eventually do) return to their humble native lands, with The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun series, where within two and a half books every single original character is some sort of super-diety flitting around through Proper_Noun and space at the drop of a hat. Ironically, in attempting to keep readers interested, writers end up creating characters that are extremely difficult to identify with (unless you\'re megalomaniacal). By spreading the weight of the storyline onto the shoulders of many, many characters, each interesting in their own right, Proper_Noun has for the Proper_Noun being avoided this classic series death-trap. While one can read the seeds of ultimate power and glory into any of the characters via the adroitly placed hints (suspiciously magical sword, pet dragons, powers of shadow), only one thing is consistent in Proper_Noun books: calamity befalls everyone. On one page a favored character could appear to be finally clawing their way out of their horrific circumstance, only to fall even farther a turn of the page later. It makes for a wonderful rollercoaster of a series, and leaves any possible resolutions either up in the air, or entirely as speculation. Where other series\' set forth the hero and simply ask Proper_Noun will he/she succeed", Proper_Noun sets forth a dozen potential "heroes", and asks "Will any of them succeed?". It\'s the question we want answered, and that\'s why we keep coming back.
