5..Book 1 was pretty interesting, basically focused on 2 families; the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun - with a side on the 2 survivors of the previous Proper_Noun lineage who would factor in later in the battle for the throne. And Proper_Noun Proper_Noun child of previous Proper_Noun is very very boring to read about...her stuff could be condensed to fewer and shorter chapters. (She even bored me in season 1 the Proper_Noun series based on this book - which by the Proper_Noun is more like watching porn.)By book 3 the focus was less and less on these main characters and more on others. Very obviously in there to add more volumes and not to make the story more interesting. The story seemed to be expanding for the sake of expanding. As if getting more complicated makes you a better author.I might have stopped after book 3, but since there are only 5 books I went on. ...it took me Proper_Noun to get through book 4 (because it just wasn\'t holding my interest - so much of it was wasted on stuff I didn\'t care about and missing the characters that I Proper_Noun care about).Now Proper_Noun reading book 5 and a good chunk of it should have been in book 4 because book 4 went Proper_Noun this, and now it\'s taking you back to fill in details. Stuff you might have wanted to know Proper_Noun but now that you already know what happens the going back for details is just frustrating... and Proper_Noun reading in a pissed off mood now wondering why the hell the author didn\'t just do it in order of events unfolding or leave it out? It\'s like someone dropped chapters on the floor and they just picked them up and printed them out of order. (I think more thought goes into planning the lineup of songs on a Proper_Noun frustrated wondering why he is wasting my time on these other characters and why isn\'t the story progressing more towards a conclusion - or at least being more interesting in the process?Book is 5 so clearly not even close to the end of the story which had I known this, I would not have begun! (Especially after forcing myself to read the whole dang series by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - which could\'ve/should\'ve easily been half as many volumes!) In books 4 &amp; 5 the story barely advances at all - who knows how many volumes this is going to end up to be to get to the end. And at Proper_Noun a book it gets expensive to finish a series.I really wish authors wouldn\'t do this. They get a story idea that\'s good for a few books and then make a deal to deliver Proper_Noun more volumes which means they have to complicate it with more and more meaningless fluff and sub-stories. More volumes doesn\'t make it a better story!!********************************************************BOTTOM LINE on this book series: Proper_Noun even start this.********************************************************You might want to try reading books by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun instead. (Goodkind Proper_Noun pretty well with his long series, managing to keep the story moving along - though around book 4 he was constantly catching up readers who perhaps didn\'t read previous volumes, which gets annoying, so there could\'ve been less volumes, but it was nowhere near as annoying as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Or, for a more modern day fantasy series, I HIGHLY recommend the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series - lots of snappy wit in those and good story in each volume.
