13I have been spoiled by this book, and by the subsequent books that have come out in this series.I am now completely unable to read Proper_Noun fantasy book without comparing its level of quality with that of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and, sadly enough, very few compare at all.Everything about this series rings true: the characters, the complicated plot, the prose, the action, the dialogue.For those readers who are looking for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun read, do not pick up this book. I can understand that sometimes Proper_Noun heavy epic is just too much, especially after having finished another (I know how it is to try and read ANYTHING after flogging through the tenth Proper_Noun Proper_Noun But if you are looking for epic fantasy that is not simply \'good v. evil\' or \'hero who knows nothing about the world, yet ends up saving it,\' please give this book Proper_Noun try.The characters are fully fleshed, with actual personalities. They are not Proper_Noun or \'evil\' but Proper_Noun little of both within themselves. There is no such thing as an \'invincible\' character. All these characters are human, with human needs, thoughts, desires, lives, and decisions to make.The plot is not convoluted; it is complex. There is Proper_Noun difference. And it is not Proper_Noun lighthearted fantasy. There is darkness and evil here that has nothing to do with magic, but is instead related to the pitfalls of the human nature.Please, please, if you wish Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would wrap the hell up, if you love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and thought that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun first book was Proper_Noun disaster of hackneyed prose and ripped-off characters -- please, please try this book. It is well worth your while.
