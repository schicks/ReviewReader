9A bit jumpy at the beginning this book smooths out quickly and gives the reader the suspense and action that he/she craves. Unlike many authors, Proper_Noun does not fall so in love with his characters that they must become godlike in their abilities. If you have ever found yourself chearing for the bad guy in desperation (see The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun kill someone already!) or if you have ever been so sick of heros that never die and are basically perfect (see The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun throw a tantrum will ya!) then this is a series for you.The action is great and the plot keeps you guessing. In this book and series you will never be sure what will happen next. All of the characters are gritty and real.Best of all good and evil, young and old, guilty and innocent; they all have and equal chance of making mistakes and of dying. Proper_Noun proves that heros can be killed and yet the story goes on. At a Proper_Noun when many authors aspire to write epic journeys that we can fall in love with, Proper_Noun has found the secret that so many have missed. We loved Proper_Noun because his fantasy characters where so humanly fallible. Proper_Noun understood that there is no character good or evil so complete that you cannot love them or kill them.Martin takes you through an incredible journey of kingdoms and generations, killing off one and seamlessly replacing it with the next. In a world of long summers and longer winters the people are harsh and the land is cruel. The decisions are hard and final. No room for mistakes or sympathy. No man, woman, or child escapes the trials of a frozen world. Each decision leads closer to the brink. Every choice pits the demands of family, honor, and life at odds. No matter what something has to lose out to something else. The only question is which characters will make the right choices and which will bring down disaster on their world.Read this book and all of the ones that follow! You will not be disappointed!
