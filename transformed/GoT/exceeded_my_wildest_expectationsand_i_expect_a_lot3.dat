855I see where Proper_Noun reviewer below faulted Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for being so chock-full Proper_Noun Proper_Noun bloodshed, cruelty, death, rape, incest, drunkeness, murder, Proper_Noun infanticide."Heh. Where I come from, that\'s Proper_Noun five-star recommendation.Glibness aside, the person has Proper_Noun point. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is indeed Proper_Noun graphic, viciously unsentimental novel. It features all the offenses listed above and more besides. It revels in them.Can\'t you people see? That\'s the Proper_Noun writers Proper_Noun heroic fantasy like to write about huge and epic struggles between capital-letter Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Yet over and over again they demonstrate only the most puerile understanding Proper_Noun what Proper_Noun and evil actually are. In their blinkered, constrained little worlds, "evil" consists Proper_Noun sitting in Proper_Noun dank tower all day sending orcs or demons or what-have-you after the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or some similarly-named hogwash artifact. Not even the darkest Proper_Noun their generic Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would be caught boffing his own sister or murdering Proper_Noun child (much less get away with it), and in that fundamentally nonsensical bit Proper_Noun characterization lies the crux Proper_Noun their problem: by sticking horns and Proper_Noun lightning staff onto Proper_Noun one-dimensional pulp villain and calling it Proper_Noun Proper_Noun they cheapen and debase Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and evil.I\'m sure most Proper_Noun these writers realize this perfectly well; the problem is that they\'re writing to one Proper_Noun the most idiotically attenuated audiences on the face Proper_Noun the planet, people who really want to read the same book over and over ad infinitum with just enough variation from the template to create the illusion Proper_Noun difference. It\'s Proper_Noun sad state Proper_Noun affairs when we consider that fantasy, which should rightly be the domain Proper_Noun myth, wonder, and what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun calls "mad, beautiful ideas," is the second most rigidly unimaginative genre out there (right behind romance, with whom it shares more than Proper_Noun few readers and tropes).The "Song Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series is Proper_Noun show-stopping six volume call to arms against this nonsense. Readers who come to the novels expecting another eminently predictable generic quest might be lulled to quiescence in the first few innocuous chapters, but will awake - sooner or later - to the unsettling realization that they\'re playing Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin\'s Proper_Noun now. In Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun he systematically slaughters every sacred cow Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fantasy" and, in so doing, injects Proper_Noun vigor and Proper_Noun zest for life and the written word into the genre that hasn\'t been seen since the beautiful insanity Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Heroes die and villains turn out to be not so bad after all. Magic appears only very rarely, making it infinitely more interesting. The plot steadfastly refuses to go where you\'d expect. And lest you purists think that Proper_Noun holds fantasy in contempt, consider this: unlike practically every other fantasy writer out there, he\'s gone to the trouble Proper_Noun writing this novel as if it were the most serious literature: his characters and their motivations are fully fleshed out Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are especially well-done), his prose is exciting and full Proper_Noun witty and lovely turns Proper_Noun phrase, and his themes are complex and multilayered. In other words, he\'s actually assumed that his readership is *intelligent.*After reading this and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I have renewed hope for the future Proper_Noun fantasy. Works like these deserve to be read, reread, and passed to friends; they yank the genre - and its readers - out Proper_Noun bed and lead it blinking and cursing into the light Proper_Noun genuine literary merit.
