12In all seriousness, I had major doubts when I picked this book up. I thought that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun couldn\'t be rivaled. I was wrong to Proper_Noun certain extent.Actually, there is no real accuarate way to compare Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun to The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun George Proper_Noun Martin, unlike Proper_Noun seems to delight in shocking his readers. His plot runs smoothly with shockers left and right. This man knows how to set Proper_Noun mood and play around with it. Martin knows how to toy with people\'s emotions.The characters are very nicely portrayed. Although I don\'t think of Proper_Noun charcters as friends, like I do RJ\'s, he definitely has Proper_Noun firm control over them. These are not your typical action or fantasy heroes and villians. It wasn\'t until last parts of the book that I was able to figure out exact how the alliances run and to establish Proper_Noun hero-villian relationship. Even then, you don\'t really think of villians as "villians," but rather, heroes that took Proper_Noun wrong turn.Excellent book. If you\'re Proper_Noun hard core fantasy reader who likes character/plot developments, this is it.
