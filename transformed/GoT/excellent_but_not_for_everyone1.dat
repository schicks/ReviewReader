16Having just finished reading Proper_Noun I can honestly state that I have very rarely read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as imaginative and daring as this one. I have read lots of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ad nauseum.), and this stands out from the crowd.The storyline is incredible and always keeps you guessing. Martin will do whatever it takes to further the story in Proper_Noun realistic way. As so many reviewers have stated in the past, there is Proper_Noun moral greyness surrounding the characters that adds interest to the story.You may have noticed that in the title, I stated that this book was not for everyone, and indeed, it is not. If violence and/or sexual situations make you uncomfortable, then you may find this book unsettling. The violence and sex are not gratuitous; instead, they help show you the realities of the world as it was. I have no problem with this, but I have seen several reviewers who are looking for an escape to Proper_Noun happy fairy-land fantasy, which this most definitely is not. Also, if you enjoy having every character in Proper_Noun novel capable of levelling Proper_Noun city with Proper_Noun thought or tossing fireballs about like confetti (i.e., The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun books, among others), then you will be disappointed; the magic in this book is subtle and mysterious, to both the characters and the reader.I have read only three other works of Proper_Noun that are on par with Proper_Noun work, and they are Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and of course, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Of all of these, Proper_Noun works remind me most of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun which he claims was part of his inspiration for writing in this genre.Martin\'s prose is extremely well written, with the descriptions bringing things to life in your mind. The dialogue is also brisk and clever. The story is told from multiple points of view, which adds suspense and flavor to the story, as well as allowing the author to bring each character to life, making us love them sometimes and hate them at other times.If you are sick of bloated and repetitious Proper_Noun where everyone is omnipotent and characters are static and boring, pick of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and its sequel, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun - I promise that you won\'t be disappointed.
