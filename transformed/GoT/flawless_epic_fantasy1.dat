25Let me start by saying that I am NOT Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fan. In my opinion, the characters are flat, it takes him four or five entire volumes to do Proper_Noun decent amount of character development, and the story never seems to go anywhere. That being said, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun And Proper_Noun Proper_Noun title for this epic) blows The Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun completely out of the water. You can almost imagine Proper_Noun bowing down at Proper_Noun feet to pay him homage...the setting is incredibly well-developed and fleshed out, every single character is unique and thought out, the story is well-paced, and it never seems to slow down. I can also happily report, being about halfway through Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun third book in the series) that it keeps getting better! Proper_Noun manages to shock his audience by never stooping in the quality of his work...the story continues to move along at Proper_Noun nice pace, and I just haven\'t been able to put these books down. One thing I should say however, particularly for the benefit of parents...in an effort to make the world of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun And Proper_Noun more realistic (an effort at which Proper_Noun succeeds on an unprecedented scale), the writer has included Proper_Noun significant amount of graphic, adult content...including incest, strong sexual themes, and violence often described in gory detail. This is not Proper_Noun complaint; I really thought that these themes only helped add to the story\'s effect Proper_Noun war ain\'t pretty, folks), but I always think it\'s good that parents receive Proper_Noun \'heads-up\' if they are thinking of buying this book for their children. All in all, an amazing piece of work, and Proper_Noun breath of fresh air for the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone.
