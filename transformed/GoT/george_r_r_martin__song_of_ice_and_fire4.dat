12I: Proper_Noun Game of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for Proper_Noun due out this fall)(V: Proper_Noun Dance with Proper_Noun uncertain release date - but it is partially finished)Come ye, come ye, you who drudged through the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun you who were entangled by Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun you who were seduced by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and entrapped by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun say that this series is better than Proper_Noun of its contemporaries. This is fantasy that plays for keeps. All of the characters are human and round - there are heroes on both the \'good\' and the Proper_Noun sides. When Proper_Noun writes from Proper_Noun character\'s viewoint, you really sympathize with that character while you are in his head. In fact, I think Proper_Noun paints the most empathetic characer portraits in Proper_Noun fantasy book I have read. You really care about the characters. It is his greatest strength.Of course that makes their deaths so much more significant. This is Proper_Noun gritty and harshly Proper_Noun fantasy that plumbs the depths of treachery, honor and love. No character is immune from the events of the world and many main characters are killed off throughout the books. The world is harsh, but all of its harshness is modeled after the real world. The world of this series is as snug and well-thought-out as Proper_Noun of the others, but as this is one place where nearly every fantasy author gets it right, Proper_Noun deserves no special credit.There is hardly Proper_Noun magic in these books, which makes what magic there is much more effective, and scary when it has to be. Like in Proper_Noun magic is Proper_Noun thing of which there is much evidence in the past, but which has almost disappeared. In fact it becomes clear that the magic of Proper_Noun world is merely laying dormant. The conflict between human Proper_Noun seems to be just giving way to Proper_Noun conflict between two equally scary magical forces. (Both fire and ice are shown as wild, seductive, uncaring, uncontrollable.) While in most fantasy books, some kind of ultimate Proper_Noun ends up fighting some kind of Proper_Noun incarnate, still there is no Proper_Noun and bad in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun except for within the minds of the characters.Oh, and the Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun The politics of this series is twisty and intricate, with seven great Proper_Noun who each are constantly trying to gain more influence, but never does it turn into the sort of pointless and boring games that Proper_Noun bludgeons through in Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun (Wheel of Proper_Noun reference.) There is always Proper_Noun point to the plots, they always make sense. Characters ACT, they do not sit around thinking too much. As you read, Proper_Noun is excellent at making you care about what\'s going on. Because of his immense gift for this stuff, you\'ll actually Proper_Noun almost every one of his hundred characters and the machinations that involve them. This is definitely and PRIMARILY Proper_Noun political fantasy.I absolutely love these books. They are very very different from Proper_Noun and as far as I can see borrow very little from the professor; it reads like Proper_Noun historical fiction for the beginning (a Proper_Noun deal of the world and the plot is based on the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun that is crossed with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun creativity and inspiration and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun rigor. (If you are looking for influences, those two authors have given Proper_Noun lot to this work. Martin, however, is no fool and takes from each their best qualities - what made me read them in the first place.) I cannot emphasize enough Proper_Noun gift for characterization and for tale-weaving. The quality of the writing itself is excellent.I am blinded by the excellence of this series. I truly cannot see Proper_Noun fault. Proper_Noun is scintillating and totally unpredictable. He worked for ten years as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writer and his dialogue is as witty as hell. I have fallen in love with at least three of his characters.Seriously, if you have read these books you will know what I am talking about. Not since Proper_Noun have I given up all my reservations about Proper_Noun series simply because I loved it so much.The first three are out in paperback. I say, try and find them as soon as possible, even though the sixth and last book is probably not going to be out for another five years. The books are Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun length but they fly by. (Maybe because the same amount of stuff happens in one Proper_Noun book as in.. let\'s see.. one and Proper_Noun half of the first few jordan books, or two of the later ones.) I just finished book number three.
