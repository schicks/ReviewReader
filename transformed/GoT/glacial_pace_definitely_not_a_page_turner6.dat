15I have now read the whole series to date over the last week or so, based on the recommendation of a friend, and I cannot believe I wasted all that time. I kept hoping, in disbelief, that the story would somehow move forward. About 75% of the narrative is plodding, unnecessary dialogue that adds nothing to the story. Proper_Noun keeps adding more and more characters until by the fifth book there is something like 500 different characters and 50+ different sub-plots. Just when you become interested and invested in a character\'s story, Proper_Noun moves on and you are lucky to see that character for another 2,000 pages (e.g. Bran, Proper_Noun etc). Apparently, this is going to be another Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun type series that will take 20 years to wrap up. I will not be continuing on with the series.
