12Reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun "Game of Proper_Noun after watching the Proper_Noun production is a fascinating experience. My appreciation for the film adaptation grew as I realized that-- in nearly all particulars --nothing of importance was omitted in the transition from text to screen. While I can now understand the place of importance this story holds among many of my friends, I can now attest that the film adaptation is so true to the book (and-- dare I say it-- improves upon it in several aspects) that a further investment of my time spent by reading subsequent volumes will not be necessary. If Proper_Noun plans to continue the series, I am perfectly content following the story onscreen.Much has been made of the supposedly difficult task of following plotlines with such a large cast of characters, a criticism which probably says more about the declining attention-span of your average literary critic than anything about the characters who inhabit Proper_Noun world. While one cannot deny the presence of many characters, they are each filled-in with passions, torments, and histories which make them palpable and convincing. Even if one momentarily forgets the place a specific character holds in the narrative, Proper_Noun masterfully provides clues when the character re-emerges later to help one find one\'s way again.A story this large doubtless may yield several messages. To me, what stands out is that when people act out of fear to protect the ones they love, their actions can have unintended-- and tragic --consequences.Consider Proper_Noun Proper_Noun demise. It is likely that his life was already forfeit the moment he opposed Proper_Noun ascension, but he blackened his name in the end by admitting to crimes of which he was never guilty to protect his daughter\'s life. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun impulsive action of seizing Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for his supposed hand in attacking her family led to the rapid disintegration between the Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun placing her husband and daughters\' lives in jeopardy. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ill-fated decision to encourage the use of sorcery to save her husband from his mortal wound resulted in the destruction not only of their relationship, but of the life of her unborn child.Such consequences give the story a heavy undercurrent of loss, and Proper_Noun does not spare the reader from facing them in such scenes as Proper_Noun belated realization that her rash decision to sieze Proper_Noun Proper_Noun set the events in motion which led to the death of her husband, and Proper_Noun suffocation of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun when she realizes that he will live a half-life after being revived with black magic.After reading the book, I have new appreciation for how effectively the Proper_Noun production brings Proper_Noun story faithfully to live. (Martin was executive producer of the Proper_Noun series, so this is no accident.) While some departures from the text were inevitable, such as the omission of Proper_Noun secret journey to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by sea, or Proper_Noun valiant actions during the battle with the Proper_Noun the relationships between the characters holds true to the text; in some places, the film even improves upon them.Consider Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In the film, her animosity toward Proper_Noun Proper_Noun bastard, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is made clear early in the series. In the book, this animosity reaches almost caricature levels, such as when Proper_Noun names Proper_Noun a bastard and tells him that he should have fallen from the tower instead of her natural son, Proper_Noun Such hostility toward Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a character who, by the end of the book, remains one of the upright, true heroes left alive, robs the character of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of any sympathy. Despite her later trials, I found it difficult to feel any pity for her, given her cruel treatment of Proper_Noun after Proper_Noun fall. By altering this scene for the film, Proper_Noun allowed Proper_Noun to become the object of later sympathy, despite her coldness toward Proper_Noun Proper_Noun significant departure is the age of the children. In the book, we learn that many of the characters are barely teenagers-- Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is 13 when she is forced into marriage with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Robb Proper_Noun is 11 at the start of the series, and is only 15 when he outwits Proper_Noun Proper_Noun on the battlefield. Sansa Proper_Noun is 11 when she is betrothed to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun These characters are represented as late teenagers for the film production-- to the filmmakers\' credit. By accelerating their age for the screen, Proper_Noun makes it easier for the viewer to believe the characters capable of acting through passion in a way which would have been harder to imagine in children.As I mentioned, I do not plan to continue reading the series, despite my enjoyment of the first installation. Proper_Noun has so faithfully brought Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun epic to life that I find myself unable to justify the marginal benefits which would accrue after making a further investment of time in one of Proper_Noun doorstoppers.
