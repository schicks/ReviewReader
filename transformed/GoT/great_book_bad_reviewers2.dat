8Okay. First my review. Excellent book. I stayed up six hours at my sister\'s house and missed Proper_Noun dinner with Proper_Noun family just so I could see how it turned out. Great story. Great plot. Great characters. Great writing. (Okay, a lot of characters are gits, and I get Proper_Noun feeling that if every fantasy character had just a LITTLE more common sense, stories might be a whole lot shorter. Example: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun will you join me on my quest? Bilbo: No. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun On to my nasty comment: Proper_Noun like to say Proper_Noun on Proper_Noun for posting a review Proper_Noun Proper_Noun review just above all Proper_Noun reader reviews) which gives away not one, not two, but Proper_Noun major spoilers. Anyone who reads that review will know from Proper_Noun very beginning one of Proper_Noun mysteries which pushes forward Proper_Noun plot. It\'s like reviewing Proper_Noun Murders at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by lambasting Proper_Noun for having had Proper_Noun monkey do it. Sure, it\'s a silly ending, but it\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Anyway... good book. Buy it. Since my sister\'s place is in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I had to duck out of dinner early so I could drive Proper_Noun hours to a 365-days-a-year store in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to buy Proper_Noun second in Proper_Noun series. That says a lot.
