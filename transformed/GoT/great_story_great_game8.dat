29This is a great game. If you like games of strategy with a great story behind it, this is the game for you. The game doesn\'t require that you have read the books though. If you\'ve read the books then you\'d probably agree with me that this board game really brings out the best of the books. It\'s a very well designed game. Honestly this game is very balanced and it\'s hard for one player to run away with it. It\'s fun. A lot of fun. And yes... Winter is coming...
