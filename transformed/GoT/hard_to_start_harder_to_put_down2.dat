20Two friends urged me to read this book and I will admit that I had Proper_Noun very hard time getting started; the first hundred pages were grueling. But, I attribute that to Proper_Noun shift in writing style; the style is far removed from what I am used to. That said, the style places the reader with an individual character for an entire chapter. The reader is aware of the thoughts and feelings of the character but, frequently, the time and place is slightly different from chapter to chapter. Time moves with no notation to the reader other than, maybe, remembrances of the character that they are with.Once the characters were formed and I had Proper_Noun grasp of the world, of which detail as with the characters unfolds as the reader gets deeper and deeper in to the book, I found that I couldn\'t put the book down.I borrowed the first book from Proper_Noun friend and now I own Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and eagerly await Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for Proper_Noun series is not the high fantasy that I expected it to be. There is no clear quest outlined from the beginning, no Proper_Noun to be returned no damsel to save, no particular antagonist, no particular protagonist. Rather, it is Proper_Noun complex web of intrigue, good intentions gone bad, naivete\', ambition and pure determination. All well done and deliciously woven into Proper_Noun series that will have you rooting for, sometimes, the bad guy who later turns out to be Proper_Noun good guy and sometimes the good guy who later turns out to be Proper_Noun bad guy.Enjoy!
