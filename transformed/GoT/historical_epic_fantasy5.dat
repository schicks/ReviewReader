17The first installment of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun reveals Proper_Noun genius in creating Proper_Noun feudal society and the political machinations that went on behind the scenes. The end result is that everything seems real...and it is only when Proper_Noun direwolf or other non-earth creature appears that you remember that this is not Proper_Noun (wonderfully done) recreation of European history, Proper_Noun wall and all. (But then again, maybe it is!) His characters come in so many assortments and with so much psychological depth that there is always something new, something deeper to discover about an individual and there is always someone you love to hate or to mourn with. An author who can do that on the scale that Proper_Noun does is truly Proper_Noun dedicated, talented, hardworking author, and every page reveals that Proper_Noun is just that. The writing is superbly crafted, the situations and plot carefully and intricately developed. The book is full of many surprises and developments that kept me unable to put it down, and I awaited the 2nd volume with much anticipation and Proper_Noun read the 3rd as soon as it comes out. This book truly earned its 5 stars.
