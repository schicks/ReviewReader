5I know, I know! Proper_Noun one of the few. I just couldn\'t get into it. I tried. I have a hard time saying why, too.I liked the prologue enough, and I thought I was in for a treat. But after a few hundred pages, I found myself not reading as I read. It seemed a chore to pick up. After I started dreading it, I stopped reading. I found that I didn\'t care for any characters yet, which for me, is a must if Proper_Noun gong to read. I have to at least be mildly interested in Proper_Noun I hear it gets better. But with so many other options, I want better now. :)As for the series being Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun not so sure. It didn\'t Proper_Noun all the revolutionary to me, but then again, I didn\'t get far.Regardless, I enjoy the old school fantasy books full of hope and cheesy dialog. I do LOVE a dark book crammed with one obstacle after another until you Proper_Noun you can\'t breathe while reading because everything seems so hopeless. You know, the one you actually ache in sympathy for the main character who gets knocked down only to rise and hit repeat because they refuse to give up. I didn\'t Proper_Noun anything in Proper_Noun No humor, sadness, cheering, yelling at the characters. Nothing.So for me, I couldn\'t finish it.
