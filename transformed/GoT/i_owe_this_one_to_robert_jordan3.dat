38If Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had not written Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I most likely would not have read this book just yet. I had had it lying around the house for several years, but had not been motivated to pick it up and read it. Then, many of the slams of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun suggested that we read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin to see some good writing. I figured that that many readers can\'t be wrong, and I was right! Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is the best fantasy of intrigue that I have read since Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun trilogy, if not ever.The fact that the book is somewhat patterned on the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun does not detract from the richness of the world Proper_Noun Martin has created. And this world is not defined by drawn-out, detailed descriptions and charts, but by the clarity of the prose. In fact, the genealogies and characteristics of the great houses are spelled out so well in the story that the appendix at the end is almost superfluous.The characters are terrific. Although some are "better" than others, no one is truly "good" or "evil". Instead, we are presented with a cast of normal individuals in extraordinary times. How they interact, react, grow, and/or regress comprises the bulk of the action.Having said that, I must also say that this is a novel of ideas and personalities. It is not "slash and burn" fantasy, but its use of magical arts is mostly insinuated and any actual acts or situations are limited to what is necessary to advance Proper_Noun Martin\'s ideas. Some previous reviewers have complained about the scarcity of magic. I beg to differ, as the rarity of magic adds to its power in those instances that it appears. All is in context; there are no gratuitous displays of grandiose "swords and sorcery" to attempt to revive a plot gone stale or just for their own sake.This is a tale of people. They fight, they grow, they plot, they scheme, they are noble, they are despicable, they struggle, they triumph over long odds, they fail, they die, but they always entertain. In other words, they are like people that we all know, wish we knew, or wish we didn\'t know. It\'s tempting to say that the "villains" are too evil until we remember that history is full of people like the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun closing, I feel obligated to add a slight disclaimer - parts of the story evoke intense emotion, there are "adult" situations and behavior, and people you grow to like will die, and will die far to early. But those are the things that make this book soar above most of the others in the genre. I have already begun reading the second book, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun will follow that with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and will anxiously await book 4!!
