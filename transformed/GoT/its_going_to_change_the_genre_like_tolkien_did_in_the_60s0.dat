30Over the last 30 years almost every series in the fantasy genre is the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun told with different characters in a different setting. Jordan and Proper_Noun are just 2 big name authors who\'ve made money on retelling the same kind of story. George Proper_Noun has changed the look of fantasy with his first installment of this series. The book isn\'t your typical fantasy novel about a young hero setting out on a long journey that will save the world. Its about something that happened 1000 years ago. Its about people fighting over the crown of a powerful kingdom, stopping at nothing to try and achieve their goal. This is going to be what authors will model their work after over the next few decades like they have been doing since the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Its the most pwerful book Proper_Noun ever read in my life surpassing all these other authors. He writes about humans going for real goals, not saving the universe from the ultimate evil. The characters are real, the plot believeable, and not one page is wasted.
