3,105NB: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This is Proper_Noun great book, and Proper_Noun eaten up Proper_Noun series and have been on tenterhooks for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun get his finger out and publish Proper_Noun Dance with Proper_Noun for Proper_Noun now. (And Proper_Noun tv series!! Be still my beating heart!!!) But I have Proper_Noun comment on Proper_Noun extremely bad editing of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun It is sloppy and unprofessional. When I first got my kindle, I never experienced this, but now it seems like every book gets worse and worse. I thought Proper_Noun was bad, but Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun starts out with poor editing and gets progressively more appalling as you get further into Proper_Noun book. People who only read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun will think that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun comes from Proper_Noun since that is how it is (almost) consistently spelled throughout Proper_Noun book. (It\'s Proper_Noun But on Proper_Noun other hand, Proper_Noun `tom cat\' is Proper_Noun `torn cat\'- go figure. Little things like that at first, but now, in Proper_Noun last third of Proper_Noun book, Proper_Noun mistakes are coming on nearly every page. Random parentheses, inappropriately capitalized words, italics that make no sense, sentences that end abruptly - that kind of thing. It would be irritating, but something I would just accept in Proper_Noun free Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun book (maybe). But for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book that costs more than Proper_Noun paperback, I expect more. I also own Proper_Noun hard copy of Proper_Noun book, and none of these typos are in that edition. I\'m not sure how Proper_Noun Proper_Noun editions are made, but I expect Proper_Noun same kind of professional editing that you get in print books. You don\'t get that here, disappointingly.
