51I won\'t comment about the story of this great, gripping, 5-star book: I just want to clarify one thing about the Proper_Noun editions (there are two), since there are many reviewers recommending to avoid Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun altogether. I bought both of them, and what I have to say is that the Proper_Noun edition you should avoid is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which is shamefully riddled with typos (some of them: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun word", Proper_Noun on", Proper_Noun instead of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and "and"). The Proper_Noun edition, though, is much, much better (not only with none or few typos, but also with a table of contents and more maps).
