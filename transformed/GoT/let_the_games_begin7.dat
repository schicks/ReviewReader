3If you\'re going to consider reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series, then be prepared for an investment. These books aren\'t for casual readers, but rather slower and more methodical ones. Requiring Proper_Noun great deal of your time, attention to detail, and the memorization of various characters\' political and social associations. The amount of content the book contains is equal to the level of commitment you are willing to give. This may sound intimidating to some people, but Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is able to deliver Proper_Noun very deep story targeting Proper_Noun mature audience because of this, though this also means the book\'s level of comprehension and adult content may become Proper_Noun deal-breaker to some people. Persevere and you\'ll enjoy one of the best fantasy epics in quite some time.As I previously said, the narrative of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun can be quite cumbersome to comprehend at the very beginning, and the faint synopsis doesn\'t exactly paint Proper_Noun very big picture of what\'s to come. So Proper_Noun decided to provide Proper_Noun brief synopsis of my own.With the murder of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun his Proper_Noun himself has requested that his old friend Proper_Noun Proper_Noun head of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun take up the role at his side in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to help him properly govern the realm. Of course taking up this honorable task would mean Proper_Noun Proper_Noun must leave the sanctity of Proper_Noun and his family. But he soon realizes that treachery and deception have consumed the nobility, no one can be trusted, everyone is trying to seize power by any means necessary; particularly the cunning Proper_Noun family. The book doesn\'t just follow the character Proper_Noun but rather Proper_Noun large collection of personas, some intertwine with the central story arc involving Proper_Noun others involve their own. Daenerys Proper_Noun one of the last of the feared Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is forced into Proper_Noun marriage with Proper_Noun savage Proper_Noun warlord in order to gain in army for the means of reconquering her rightful throne. The last major story arc involves Proper_Noun bastard son Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his indoctrination in the enigmatic `Night\'s Proper_Noun where desertion is punishable by death.While the plot of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is truly an epic piece of fiction-writing, it would be nothing if the characters weren\'t believable. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has established himself as Proper_Noun very strong character-driven author, one who focuses on the problems of these people and how they affect them. While there are characters which are not affiliated with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the majority of the major characters can be allocated into the two major noble families: the Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun characterize honor, duty, diligence, and integrity, making them the primary protagonists. They\'re opposed by the ambitiously materialistic Proper_Noun family, who seem like Proper_Noun equivalent of the Proper_Noun Though if there\'s Proper_Noun weakness in the characterization department, it would be that not enough is done with characterizing the Proper_Noun family. The Proper_Noun family makes up the bulk of the story\'s protagonists, but they aren\'t exactly perfect. They can be rude, selfish, jealous, and even bratty at times, they\'re delightfully flawed characters. With the exception of the great character `Tyrion Proper_Noun we\'re given very little insight into the life of the family aside from their obvious immoral tendencies. The Proper_Noun while morally vague, come off feeling much less defined. I really wish more could have been done with them when compared to the excellently characterized Proper_Noun family.In Proper_Noun seemingly endless miasma of betrayal and deceit, the only beacon of hope comes in the form of family. The Proper_Noun particularly the Proper_Noun children felt like the real heart of the book for me. Their precious innocence helps invest the reader in the story even further, especially since they\'re among the victims in this malicious Proper_Noun that the adults are playing. It only reinforces the insurmountable stakes and that nobody is truly safe or completely innocent.Even the world itself feels like Proper_Noun character that helps ground the reader in the author\'s fiction. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are vividly brought to life with intricate detail that makes it really pop off the pages. Its geography, political structure, and the dominant noble houses are all elaborated upon in surreal detail that really gives the reader Proper_Noun feeling of place. Less reliance on more fantastical elements like elves and dwarves gives Proper_Noun world Proper_Noun pinch of reality that most authors tend to avoid. With the exception of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the extinct dragons, all mystical aspects are kept at an all-time low, favoring words and steel over mysticism and spells. The outcome is Proper_Noun fantasy world that surprisingly, comes off as genuinely plausible. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun feels like Proper_Noun realm that very much could have existed. It\'s an interesting divergence from the typical high fantasy settings.There\'s going to be the inevitable comparison between Proper_Noun work and the legacy left behind by Proper_Noun as the great forefather of fantasy writing. The notion of comparing the two is entirely misguided, simply because Proper_Noun writing is completely different from Proper_Noun in nearly every angle. Proper_Noun emphasized the ongoing struggle between good and evil, the thrill of high adventure in Proper_Noun fantastical world, and the triumph of great heroes over terrible villains who would do the world harm. Proper_Noun on the other Proper_Noun is much less black and white with his delivery. There are obvious characters you can label as `dishonorable\', while others stand atop Proper_Noun pedestal as paragons of altruism. But are these characters truly evil for trying to secure the benefit of their family and future generations to come? And are these characters considered good if they\'re ensuring the stability of the realm by dishonest methods? Proper_Noun chose to forgo typical fantasy conventions of magic and obvious morality in the favor of characters who feel genuinely believable in all the most despicable ways. They\'re not the great heroes Proper_Noun illustrated; they\'re morally ambiguous human beings. That\'s the defining characteristic which separates these two giants of fantasy, the selfless heroes and the morally grey humans. Comparing these two juggernauts is completely irrelevant, for Proper_Noun isn\'t trying to replicate Proper_Noun but rather make his own beast.Yet, I never like to jump on Proper_Noun bandwagon and proclaim with the rest of the world that Proper_Noun novel is absolutely perfect. Of course these critiques are personal ones and admittedly border on flat-out nitpicking. The first is the absolutely insane overabundance of minor characters. I\'m not referring to the central characters that the various chapters shift between; they\'re all perfectly characterized and fascinating. I\'m referring to the endless onslaught of characters that overcrowd the book, but serve little importance in the greater scheme of things. Every story arc is jam-packed with so many characters that range from semi-important to useless. I usually wouldn\'t mention this, but with Proper_Noun book of this magnitude it really became an issue with me, though it may not for other people. The second issue is the lack of Proper_Noun proper climax to the story. I\'m all for having an intriguing plot over Proper_Noun mindless slog of action scenes, but with Proper_Noun book of this size, it would have been nice to have it end with Proper_Noun bang. It\'s little things like these that stand out when the rest of the book is just so good.When Hollywood absolutely bastardized the final Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel by splitting it into two movies in order to fill their glutinous craving for money; I became somewhat of Proper_Noun skeptic to segmenting visual adaptations of popular literature. Creating Proper_Noun television show made me raise an eyebrow, "instead of making Proper_Noun movie they\'re going to milk it with Proper_Noun whole season of episodes" I thought. After reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun I realized that making Proper_Noun television show out of the book isn\'t just Proper_Noun good idea, it\'s absolutely mandatory. This book and its sequels have so much content in them that Proper_Noun movie would never do the plot and its various characters justice. It\'s the perfect source material for an epic fantasy television series, which is great considering we don\'t exactly have many of those.A Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is the start of something special. The beginning chapter of an epic tale that needs to be read by everyone of age who can truly appreciate its complexity. Read the book first before you watch the show, only then can you truly appreciate Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun natural talent for weaving such incredible stories.
