Since that series was far from finished and I was still in an "epic fantasy book" mode, I was desperately casting around for something similar. I happened across an on-line bboard that was discussing \'A Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun The praise was universal and it seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for. So I found a copy and began to read. It is only like Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun up to a point. The similarities with Proper_Noun lie in the fact that 1) it is a multi-volume series and 2) it has lots of characters. The two series are very, very different. However, I think Proper_Noun fans will really enjoy this bookI was immediately taken in by the atmosphere of the book. It is chock full of symbolism and foreshadowing. But it is also very grounded and down to earth. This book has quite a large cast of characters. It is a fully realized world with a history, customs, landscapes, legends and a wide range of people. Yet, the story is told through the viewpoints of a very small, select number of characters. Through their eyes you get to see events unfold. This has the wonderful effect of not only allowing you to get to know the character whose viewpoint you\'re reading at the time in a very intimate way, but also allows the author to reserve the right to revisit an event through the eyes of another character and thereby give the same event an entire new meaning for the reader.Characters in this book are noble, evil, good, cynical, na\xefve and really, endearingly flawed. I have to applaud the author\'s willingness to sacrifice sympathetic characters as well as non-sympathetic ones. He doesn\'t take the easy route and I think the book is all the richer for it. I went back to reread this book after having read the 2nd and 3rd book of the series and I am pleased that it has held up beautifully to a reread. If anything, going back to read it after reading the third book of the series has made for a richer experience. This is a maddening, wonderful, heartbreaking, exciting book and I cannot recommend it enough.
