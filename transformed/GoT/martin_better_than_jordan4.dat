40As Proper_Noun relatively new reader of sci-fi and fantasy, I hadn\'t read too many of the current popular fantasy series, so I started with Proper_Noun books. While they were enthralling and the world he builds is amazingly detailed, my foray into the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series has been just as enjoyable. I can\'t decide my favorite of the two authors, but I will tell you what I like about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun observation: Proper_Noun happen. After reading entire chapters of Proper_Noun later novels that only stew in their own contemplative juices without actually going anywhere, it was refreshing to experience Proper_Noun little adventure and excitement with each chapter in Proper_Noun observation: Proper_Noun are authentic. I\'m not sure if I phrased that properly, but here\'s what I mean. After Proper_Noun while, Proper_Noun portrayal of Proper_Noun gets really annoying. Maybe it\'s just me, but they all seem so similar and uninteresting most of the time. In Proper_Noun the female characters are some of my favorites and they seem like real people to me.I hope that anyone who is reading this looking for Proper_Noun potential fantasy novel to bide their time until the next Proper_Noun book comes out will immediately add this worthy tome to their shopping cart. You may find yourself counting the days until the next Proper_Noun book rather than the next Proper_Noun book if you\'re not careful.
