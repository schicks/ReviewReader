3I\'d heard wonderful things about the series, some even going so far as to warn me, Proper_Noun will never be able to enjoy another series of books with the same fervor because those books are THAT good." It is so true that the minute I finished reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun I headed to the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to download Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun very first chapter of this book sucked me in with Proper_Noun chilling promise of fretful darkness in Proper_Noun world where you can\'t just turn on the lights to get away from the shadows. Set in Proper_Noun time and place not unlike medieval Proper_Noun the narrative is divided chapter by chapter, allowing us to enter into several of the book\'s critical characters and follow the thread of their journey. As difficult as it might seem to take us on this trip through the eyes of at least nine different characters, Proper_Noun manages to weave the entire story together fluidly, and not once did I find myself feeling lost or confused when the Proper_Noun shifted with Proper_Noun new chapter.Every character that lent voice to the story drew me into their world and made me feel for them, even the dwarf Proper_Noun Proper_Noun with his dark view and blatant honesty in Proper_Noun world all-to-unwilling to see the truth. Bran Proper_Noun became Proper_Noun favorite character early on, as I watched the world grow dark and tainted to his child\'s eyes, but failed to snuff the flame of the adventurer inside him.
