31When I read, I read for entertainment. This entertainment could be cerebral morality tales that make me question the world around me, or just old school adventure that gives me a few hours of escapism. Game of Proper_Noun has none of that. I can understand what everyone likes in these books, but I digress. I had three main problems with this book:1: While Proper_Noun can write stellar characters the rapid Proper_Noun shifting and incredibly complex plot left me unable to empathize with them or \'get into their head\' and feel what it must be like in their shoes. They came off as emotionally shallow.2:The different plot threads in this book pass by in a whirlwhind of violence and darkness that left me feeling like Proper_Noun watching them unfold from behind a thick glass window, and not in the thick of the action. Everything moves too fast for me to latch on to and really enjoy. The world itself is interesting, but underdone. Proper_Noun tries to use Proper_Noun style of dropping random details to add depth to his world, but in all the confusion those details are lost3: Its too dark. All the characters save maybe Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are either unlikeable, underdeveloped as mentioned in one, or just plain stupid. I have no reason to invest in them because they\'re all a bunch of murderous, incestuous psychopaths that I can\'t be interested in except to hope that they die painfully. I get it Proper_Noun you want to deconstruct the fantasy genre and show how brutal a real fantasy world would be, but in doing so you\'ve robbed it of its soul.I give this book a star and a half for Proper_Noun nd Proper_Noun but apart from that its just a thousand pages of fire starter. Fires are more fun anyway. Nonetheless, I did like the Proper_Noun series better and will be following it, that I can recommend to anyone.
