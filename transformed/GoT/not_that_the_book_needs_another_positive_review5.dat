12It took me Proper_Noun attempts to get through Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun I\'d heard enough compelling reviews that I felt like I should read it, but it does take some time before the plot starts unfolding and truly engaging the reader.On my third attempt, I was totally in love with the atypical fantasy world that Proper_Noun had created. He seems to have taken some cues from Asian "fantasy" writers (e.g., Romance of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun in structuring the scope of his story, but has brilliantly succeeded not only at constructing an epic among epics in terms of plotting and ingenious plot twists, but also depth of characterization, and readability-- the series staunchly avoids repetition or \'recaps,\' and the characters are without excpetion dynamic.Throughout the series, the story shifts between more than a dozen narrators, man and woman, young and old. And almost without exception, they have intriguing tales to tell. That in itself is an enormous accomplishment, as most other contemporary fantasy novels tend to have both compelling narrators and some who simply get on readers\' nerves-- Proper_Noun Proper_Noun springs to mind, as he long since seems to have lacked anything new to say. Having read the first Proper_Noun installments (around Proper_Noun thousand pages), Proper_Noun been impressed by the lack of dull moments in the course of the series. Proper_Noun always excited to pick up the narrators\' stories, yet always disappointed when a chapter ends. The only exception is the tale of an exile princess attempting to build an army on another continent-- the only character not in the immediate fray, and whose story is more in a stereotypically fantasy mode.The world Proper_Noun has constructed is not your usual fantasy world. Although populated by people who love idealistic tales of heroism and valor, just like the rest of us, they find the reality to be far different, and far more brutal. And perhaps most importantly, the line between heroism and villainy is never as clear-cut as anyone would hope.Best of all, Proper_Noun has an incredible gift for turning the tables on the reader without ever seeming manipulative, and for developing characters to the point where the reader is forced to rethink his own opinion of each individual. The series might not mean that the genre finally earns the attention it deserves, but Proper_Noun confident that there are many readers out there who will be spellbound by the author\'s magnificent achievement. And rightly so.
