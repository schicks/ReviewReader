37The wonder of this Proper_Noun is matched only by it\'s complexity. To compare it\'s similarites with Proper_Noun the only other strategy board Proper_Noun I have played, is to say they both have armies. The differences then take flight with an innovative battle system which involves no luck only strategy, ships to give Proper_Noun whole new element to consider with the transport and aid they offer, Proper_Noun system of bidding for three seperate offices which greatly affect the players ablities to operate on the field of battle. Consider before purchusing the depth of the game, as not only dose it take time to memorize the rules but the Proper_Noun itself takes time to set up with its many pieces. Yet there is no board Proper_Noun I have ever played that rewards skill rather than chance the way this one dose. Simple games are fun to pass the time, but to play Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun rich and rewarding exsperiance. All in all it takes one Proper_Noun to fully comprehend the Proper_Noun and it\'s workings and after that things go much smoother as exsperiance grows. To me worth every cent.
