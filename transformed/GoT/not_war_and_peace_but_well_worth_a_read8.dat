9I write as a Proper_Noun friar and teacher of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun formerly of literature) in Proper_Noun I found Proper_Noun book fascinating. At first the disconnected narratives are hard to follow. Then you realize that you\'re in the same world as "War and Proper_Noun -- families that interact against the backdrop of larger events. I detect the influence of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun description of the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun For those who want humanity to be nice, this is not a nice book, but it represents a wonderful re-presentation of the epic spirit in western literature. The characters are well-drawn and in many cases well-developed. The shifting of perspective may be disconcerting but the author shows a distinct bias in favor of honest, honorable characters, however gruesome their fates may be. A comparison with Proper_Noun is silly; this is a different type of epic. My only hope is that it not succumb to being drawn out to the length of Proper_Noun interminable Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun
