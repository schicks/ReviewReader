63There is something everyone who is thinking about reading this series should know, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Is that a good thing, you ask? Well, maybe.****************************************You might like this book if . . .****************************************1. You would rather read about political manipulations than fighting and war-mongering.2. Very graphic sex scenes do not bother you.3. You do not require lots of magic in Proper_Noun stories.4. You enjoy well developed, detailed characters who tend to have fatal character flaws.5. You like a very long, very in-depth mystery6. You don\'t mind reading about the "grit" of medival life. Nothing is sugar coated here, rest assured of that.7. You don\'t mind not having a central character to root for.****************************************You will hate this book if . . .****************************************1. You expect a Proper_Noun novel to have lots of Proper_Noun in it.2. If 15 pages of action out of 200 is not ok with you.3. Very detailed sexual exploits offend you.4. You want to really care about a character or need someone to root for.5. You don\'t like really long stories (if an 800 page book makes you shudder, this one Proper_Noun for you because Proper_Noun only gets worse)6. Similar sounding names infuriate you.7. You don\'t mind keeping up with 8+ plot lines and 20+ major characters.*****Magic*****There Proper_Noun a whole lot of magic in this world. Especially when compared to something like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in which everything up to, and including, the crapper is magical. Here is a list of just about everything magical I could find:1. Ancient tree spirits2. Ancient undead . . . things3. Extra long seasons. A Proper_Noun round of seasons might look like this: summer lasts 7 years, fall last 3 years, winter last 5 years, spring last 4 years, summer last 4 years, fall last 6 years, etc.4. Children grow up faster. From the way the story is written (he never explicitly says one way or another) we can conclude that children reach maturity much sooner than Proper_Noun people do. So, a 15 year old boy is equal to a 18 or 19 year old Proper_Noun boy. Likewise a 13 year old girl is equal to a 16 or 17 year old Proper_Noun girl. It is a little odd but you get use to it.*****Characters*****Many of the characters are either stock, evil or borrowed from some other pieces of fiction. There are several who are "good", many who are Proper_Noun and a handful whom are "indifferent". Yet, in spite of all of that Proper_Noun is easy believe that they are real. Proper_Noun does a good job of making them seem lifelife. So, even if you think you have seen them before they are still crafted nicely here. There aren\'t that many truly unique characters though and no one exists as "The Proper_Noun limited action considering the amount of story telling that goes on. There is a tournament, a war, lots of brawling and the occasional fist fight. If you need lots of adventure go buy a comic book because this Proper_Noun for you.*****Plot*****This is a very plot driven story. The plot is interesting, don\'t get me wrong, but Proper_Noun can get a little tiring at points. Most of the time you will try and unravel the many mysterys laid before you and thus won\'t notice Proper_Noun much) that the book is really long. Now, I am not against long books, provided there is a point to all that length. Writing just to fill space annoys me though. And while Proper_Noun is interesting, and descriptive, there are times when I think an editor should have gone though this thing a little harder than he originally did.So, overall, do I recomend this book? Sort of. If you can get past the lack of action and magic then this Proper_Noun too bad of a book. Here is an interesting note, though. If Proper_Noun had taken out the 4 somewhat magical elements of this book, changed the setting to medieval Proper_Noun and modified a few names, then this could easily sit on the "Fictional Proper_Noun shelf.
