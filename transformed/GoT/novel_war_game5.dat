64As an experienced gamer who has tried out Proper_Noun wide range of strategy-oriented products, I have found the Proper_Noun of Thrones to be an especially strong one (which is fairly surprising given that it was not designed as Proper_Noun stand-alone product but instead grows out of Proper_Noun series of genre novels). It is Proper_Noun nice Proper_Noun in all of the superficial ways: gorgeous board, sturdy and attractive pieces, strong box in Proper_Noun convenient size to add to shelf and with attractive artwork that would make you proud to have it there. But what especially impressed me is the overall unity of the design.Most niche board games come with extremely thick manuals filled with idiosyncratic rules to govern every situation. They may be enjoyable, but they take forever to learn and you generally cannot get non-gamers to invest the time. We feared this Proper_Noun would be the same, but I sat down with my wife, kids, and Proper_Noun family friend so that we could walk through the manual and we quickly realized that the rules were especially consistent and logical. Even my 12-year-old daughter picked them up quickly.If you\'re looking for Proper_Noun comparison, Proper_Noun say that among the traditional war games this one most closely resembles Proper_Noun and anyone who has played Proper_Noun will find the rules particularly comfortable to learn. The action choices are similar, and determined in advance in Proper_Noun similar fashion. Randomness plays little role in battle outcomes. And, like Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun even permits the addition of Proper_Noun negotiation session as Proper_Noun make non-binding deals with one other.But don\'t take these comparisons too far. This isn\'t Proper_Noun with Proper_Noun new thematic overlay. It would take too long to go into all the unique features of this game, but Proper_Noun highlight three big ones: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun territories offer Proper_Noun resources: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun If you also factor in whatever direct military advantage taking Proper_Noun territory might bring, the result is that Proper_Noun must make uncertain choices about which advantages to pursue and when to pursue them. (2) Proper_Noun periodically bid for positions of political influence that can help them out later, producing Proper_Noun nice tension between saving your resources vs. investing them in gaining potentially useful advantages. (3) Proper_Noun group of savages called "wildlings" will attack occasionally, threatening all the Proper_Noun at once. The rules set up an intriguing collective-action problem: Proper_Noun too much to repelling the invasion, and your rivals will have gained Proper_Noun relative advantage. Proper_Noun too little and the marauders roam the countryside, killing your people before they return home.Does the Proper_Noun have problems? We\'ve noticed one: The arrival of troops and supplies is governed by event cards, so sometimes Proper_Noun strategy will be stymied not because of any strategic error but because the needed card stubbornly refuses to pop up. But, by the odds, that kind of difficulty would only appear in Proper_Noun small percentage of games.Finally, please note that I have not read the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin novels that served as Proper_Noun point of departure for this game. I cannot testify to its level of success capturing the world depicted in the books, only its success at creating Proper_Noun fun and exciting gaming environment. At that task the Proper_Noun designers have succeeded brilliantly.
