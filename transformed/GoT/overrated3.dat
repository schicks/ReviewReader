111) I can\'t see how this classifies as "fantasy" since there exists Proper_Noun magic or supernatural aspects except in deep corners of the book; nothing like a main aspect like in Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun where magic and supernatural are a huge part of the story. If anything, this is just medieval fiction. The ONLY thing "fantasy" in this book is dragons and they\'re extinct. There are some creatures called the Proper_Noun but they exist beyond a wall and, surprise surprise, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun So 90% of the book is in this mock medieval world/timeline...how is that fantasy?2) Too many characters. It\'s easy to keep track of the main characters but Proper_Noun of the other characters get lost and you have to keep figuring out who everyone is. And for many characters, like Proper_Noun who cares about her and what she thinks? She serves Proper_Noun purpose, than after a certain event Proper_Noun spoilers) Proper_Noun just beats her around; why do i want to read about a minor character of Proper_Noun importance to the story? Space waster.3) Too slow of pace. I\'m 350 pages in and very little has happened. A kid got attacked, and almost attacked a second time...that\'s it. One could argue that the story is drawn on to seem realistic in regards to say Proper_Noun Proper_Noun investigation about his kid and the death of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but with the viewpoints and stories of other characters included (often not relative to the investigation) it makes the story really, really, long and slow. People don\'t read books for the realistic timeline, they read for entertainment; why do you think shows like Proper_Noun solve Proper_Noun crimes in an hour? Because Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would watch if they treated cases realistically that sometimes go for months, years, or are never solved.4) One of my biggest peeves with "Girl with the dragon tattoo" was that there were two story lines that took forever to merge Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun In Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun this story line of Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun keeps popping up that apparently is on a totally different continent than the rest of the book; yet only once in the 350 pages Proper_Noun read has there been any hint of the Proper_Noun story line merging with the rest of the book: Proper_Noun character worries about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun getting an arming and marching for the thrown....but oh wait, the Proper_Noun hate water and have Proper_Noun boats so let\'s not worry about them. Book continues with two separate non-merging story lines. Keeping track of Proper_Noun the characters and story lines until some big merge of Proper_Noun of them is too much work. I don\'t want to see how the pizza is made, i just want to eat it.5) GRR Proper_Noun is a creepy old man. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his wife are the only people who have normal, happy, in-love/care about the other person sex. The rest of the sex in the book is widely disturbing: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun slavery, and underage sex (Dany is only 13. AND somehow after the first time becomes an instant pro at it; yeah, that\'s realistic just like the breasts of every woman in video games). The "excuse" i hear from so many is "it\'s accurate for the time period"...wait, is Proper_Noun writing historical fiction or fantasy? Proper_Noun was set in a similar time period and isn\'t full of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun slavery, and underage sex...so what\'s the deal?I kept hearing that Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun was so awesome and i saw the 1st book for like Proper_Noun so i thought "why not"...perhaps it\'s just my anti-conformist but this book is overrated. My rule is that if a book doesn\'t grab me 100 pages i stop reading. I went to 350 only because the book is so big (didn\'t see how many pages total) and it\'s a serious let down
