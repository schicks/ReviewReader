6With stacks of books at home and a brand new Proper_Noun not yet out of the box, I found myself on a 10,000-mile flight without a book! An admired friend of mine had read the entire "A Song of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series, so I decided to give it a try. At an airport bookstore I bought the first book of the series, and I soon regretted it.I would place Proper_Noun in the same league of pop fiction writers as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun His style is flat, wordy, and immature; at least Proper_Noun can weave an intriguing story.Martin\'s characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The good guys never seem to learn, and the bad guys never seem to grow. The good guys are so stupid, make so many bad decisions, and are so easily duped by every trick, no matter how obvious, I no longer cared if they lived or died. Fortunately, Proper_Noun kills them off nice and fast.I finished the entire book and was relieved when I read the last word. Unwilling to wade through more of Proper_Noun bland writing but mildly curious as to the outcome of the series, I did an Proper_Noun search for some brief synopses. After a few minutes of reading about the second book, I rolled my eyes and went on to something more gainful. I am grateful that I did not read the entire series.I am sorry that Proper_Noun magazine proclaimed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Is that the best we have to offer? Sure, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are Proper_Noun middle names, but I begrudge the Proper_Noun R." comparison with Proper_Noun R. R. Tolkien.
