723I spent quite Proper_Noun while staring at the blank screen in front of me to come up with Proper_Noun fitting description of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Should I compare it to the classic Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun for its impressively epic scope? Would it be best to focus on the honest, often painful humanity of the many characters - so rare in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel - that personalizes each point of view? Perhaps I could impress other customers here with the sheer brilliance of Proper_Noun plot that weaves so many seemingly disparate stories together to form Proper_Noun believable alternate universe in which not only politics, intrigue, war, adventure and romance can coexist plausibly, but magic as well. How could I do such Proper_Noun work justice?I might as well get this part out of the way first. Obligatory Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun continent that bears Proper_Noun familiarity to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is coming. Proper_Noun in this world means Proper_Noun sort of mini Proper_Noun age that will last for seven years before receding. In the always-frosty Proper_Noun area, the races of nonhuman beings are gathering to advance with the snows; there are hints that there is an ancient, evil power behind their forces. At the same Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun political infighting for the Proper_Noun has begun. Overseas, the daughter of the dispossessed former Proper_Noun is maneuvering forces of her own for Proper_Noun bid for the throne. All this is told through the various stories of both Proper_Noun guys" and not-so-good guys.For starters, Proper_Noun can\'t be accurately compared to any other book or series in the Proper_Noun genre (not without insulting it). The nearest thing of its type is the laborious Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun series by Proper_Noun - see what I mean? And yet this first in the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun series is fathoms above that aimless, droning style. Martin has perfected what Proper_Noun had arguably introduced; the multiple characters\' points of view telling the vast saga on an intimate, up-close scale. Never did I feel that I was being strung along, but rather lead by increments toward an incredible revelation somewhere up ahead. Martin builds the suspense masterfully in each book.But by far the most striking thing about the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is the "rules" that the author breaks. Martin is not afraid to tell the tale from the point of view of some very unlikable, even immoral characters. He is bold about revealing facts from Proper_Noun character\'s past that challenge one\'s impressions and assumptions about their ethics. He does not lay all his cards on the table up front, but rather unexpectedly reveals details that later change the whole picture and twist the plot admirably. And his most unusual move: this author even allows "favorites" to die occasionally (no names here...)! These risks pay off well to serve the story as Proper_Noun whole, bring Proper_Noun sense of true humanity to the people of this world and drive the reader on to the next series installment.It\'s just too bad that I can\'t magically transplant my sense of admiration for Proper_Noun onto this page. Hopefully, you are intrigued enough to give it Proper_Noun try; it would be Proper_Noun shame to miss what Proper_Noun could be the best series of the decade.-Andrea, aka Proper_Noun
