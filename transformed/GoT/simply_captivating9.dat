17It is difficult to offer this book praise that hasn\'t already been offered, but I would feel remiss not to chime in as this is without question one book among the best Proper_Noun ever read. The book is structured so that within the main story, there are a large number of other stories, each reliant upon a specific character. What the book amounts to is a collection of stories about a large cast of specific and very deeply developed characters that, when taken as a whole, begin to paint a picture of the larger "story-behind-the-story." Each individual chapter of the book rises into climax and resolution, giving it the feel of constant action and tension, while continuously setting up future conflicts. The main story doesn\'t resolve, and in fact deepens just as the book concludes, paving the way for what promises to be an explosive second volume. I\'ll wrap up with a few comments to respond to some of the reviews I read before starting this book:1. There is a good bit of sex, and some profanity, but only as seems necessary to establish traits and personalities of the main characters. Although at times graphic, these parts are not drawn out or dwelt upon and are not typically made to be focal points of the story. They are accessories for the sake of characterization, doing their job well, driving the reader to deeper love/hate of the character involved.2. Anyone who says that the plots don\'t resolve doesn\'t understand the structure of the book. This isn\'t one story. It is many that are interwoven.3. There are indeed Proper_Noun of major characters, and at first it seems daunting to try to get to know them all and keep track of who is doing what. Trust me when I say this resolves very quickly as you get to know the characters and their houses and involve yourself with their lives. This is what makes this book rich. It is a depth Proper_Noun not seen in any other novel Proper_Noun read.4. The book leaves much to interpretation. Being character driven, you will love some characters, and you will hate some. The beauty is that, much as in real life, the choices are left up to you. There is no real "good guy/bad guy" here. I find that within the same houses there are family members that I truly love, and those that so anger me I can almost experience them tangibly.I can\'t say enough about this book. It is the most deeply developed, emotionally moving, heart stirring, adrenalin pumping, vastly entertaining, beautifully and classicly written piece of modern literate art I have read in a very, very long time. Just wow.
