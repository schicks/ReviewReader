3After seeing the previews for Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun on Proper_Noun in the weeks leading up to the premier episode on 4/17/2011, Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun looked like your typical Proper_Noun times storyline full of knights in shining armor, sword fights, debauchery and that kind of stuff. I was somewhat disinterested...until Proper_Noun few days before the premier I happened to catch Proper_Noun making-of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun production. So I set my Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun glad that I did. Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun was one of the best things on TV in 2011. It was so good that I purchased the book to get the source\'s perspective, and after finishing the book Proper_Noun say that the Proper_Noun adaptation of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun kept the storyline about 98% intact with very few liberties.It was great to read the book after seeing the show to be able to put faces with all of the names. The standout descrepany from book to screen is the age of many of the prime characters. I guess that in Proper_Noun book it\'s okay to write about tennagers commiting acts of violence, having sex or worse getting raped, but apparantly Proper_Noun thought Proper_Noun lot of that would land them in hot water on the screen. And they would probably be correct.Game of Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun very long read with Proper_Noun ton of words, side stories and descriptions that could have been left out without affecting the story at all. In fact as I look at some of the reviews for some of the subsequrent books it\'s Proper_Noun common complaint by fans. But I was glued to every bit of this first in the series and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun few chapters into the second in the series called Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun sets the stage for the rest of the epic series and introduces what Proper_Noun guessing will be the key players. Although who knows based on the surprising demise of some characters that you\'d have thought would "never die" by the end of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun What\'s clear is that war lies in the future and the book details the violent struggles among the land\'s controlling families and kingdoms. And as there will evidently be more than just human encounters to deal with in the struggles for power as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and the rest of the story unfolds.I\'m hooked on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun be done with Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun prior to the second Proper_Noun season which is Proper_Noun nice reversal of order. Don\'t miss this series if you\'re into the action/fantasy genre.
