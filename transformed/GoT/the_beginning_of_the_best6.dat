13A Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun first installement of Proper_Noun best fantasy series Proper_Noun read so far. It is character driven fantasy at its best: all of Proper_Noun characters are unique, they grow and change, and, most importantly, they\'re believable. Indeed, this book reads more like a work of historical fiction than any other fantasy title Proper_Noun read. It is Proper_Noun daring choices throughout Proper_Noun novel that gives it its greatest strength.Unlike most other fantasy titles, magic and fantastic creatures have a very little part to play. There are no spell-slinging wizards, or magic swords, or goblins, or any of Proper_Noun other staple ingredients of most fantasy novels. The most fantastic part of this fantasy is Proper_Noun nature of Proper_Noun world\'s seasons. Summers and winters can last for years, even decades. And as those of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun say, winter is coming....As remarkable as Proper_Noun non-fantastic fantasy setting is, it is his deft control over Proper_Noun characters that is most worthy of praise. Every character, from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to a random innkeeper, is interesting. They are, for lack of a better word, alive. Proper_Noun writes so wonderfully that it is hard not to think Proper_Noun characters are sitting nearby telling you this marvellous tale. Proper_Noun doesn\'t get too wrapped up in Proper_Noun well-being of those characters, however. Unlike most other fantasy authors, Proper_Noun is willing (and able) to kill off major characters. Indeed, it is a wonderful shock to see an author that celebrates his characters by proving once and again that they are mortal. He does not kill more than he needs to in order to tell Proper_Noun tale. Indeed, Proper_Noun best way I can put it is like this:There is no main protagonist, nor is there a promenent antagonist. The story, rather, is Proper_Noun character of Proper_Noun novel. And I wouldn\'t have it any other way.
