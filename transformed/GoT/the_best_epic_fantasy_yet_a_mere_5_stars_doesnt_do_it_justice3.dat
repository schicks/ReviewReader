14If you\'re like me, you expect a "good" book to rate highly in three areas: 1. Plot 2. Characters 3. World-buildingIf a book gets high marks in these three areas, I find that it makes for an interesting read, even after multiple read-throughs. When I read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the rest of the currently-published books in the series) Proper_Noun not only ranked high in those areas, but he blew me out of the water.1. Plot: Proper_Noun unpredictable and not the typical "quest" theme seen in most fantasy. It is also multilayered, with plots going on from several points of view Proper_Noun different plots ARE interconnected as well. This keeps it interesting even when some plot lines get slow-paced at times.2. Characters: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun realistic characters with personal, family, and political issues. Proper_Noun also takes the time to make the major characters 3-D. You discover more about each character\'s backstory as the book Proper_Noun series) progresses. Also, characters Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun much like real people. BE Proper_Noun not all of the characters make it to the end, some die untimely deaths (as in real life).3. World-building: With a cast of hundreds of characters, all belonging to various families, areas of the country, etc. you get to see a lot of the landscape, buildings, and political atmosphere that exists. You also get a lot of backstory Proper_Noun history, etc) on the land. Proper_Noun also does a good job of describing the various cultures that exist. Another great perk Proper_Noun gives us is descriptions of foods and the characters\' opinions of them (I love seeing a foodie, like myself, as a main character).Some things to keep in mind...- There is a good amount of sex, language, and violence in the Proper_Noun series...as there is in real life. If you are not a fan of gritty reality this might not be the series for you...Although it might be worth a try, even if you end up skimming the grittier parts.- Don\'t get too attached to your characters. If you\'re the type that attaches to a single character and then feel crushed/devastated when they die, this might not be the series for you.- If you don\'t like long books, series, or cliff hangers...this might not be the series for you. The books are long, the plot is vast Proper_Noun many cliffhangers), and the series, it is not yet finished. So be warned...It can be a Proper_Noun long wait when you reach the end of the last published book in the series and then have to wait for the next one to come out.- if you\'re into Proper_Noun fantastical fantasy Proper_Noun magical wizards, spells, and charms everywhere or lots of direct diety intervention), this might not be the series for you. I think of it as more "historically based" fiction, with just enough magic/myth thrown in to keep you Proper_Noun the characters) guessing whether or not supernatural stuff really is going on.- Finally, if you hate dialogue and are prone to skimming between action-packed battle scenes...this is definately not the book/series for you. Believe me, there is a heap of fighting/action going on in this series. BUT there is also a lot of important dialogue, plotting, and intrigue. If you skip any of that dialogue, etc. You will be clueless later in the book/series because of how complicated the plot/s is/are.In closing... READ Proper_Noun and you won\'t be sorry!
