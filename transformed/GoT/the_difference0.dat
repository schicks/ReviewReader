11This fantasy series is arguably the best Proper_Noun ever seen. I\'m just now getting around to writing Proper_Noun review of it, even though Proper_Noun read it thrice since 1999. Now, before you say "Ugh, another fanatic!", just look at three major differences (in Proper_Noun genre of worn-out plots and character types, this is Proper_Noun good thing) between this book and others.1. In Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun there is almost no magic. Some people may see this as Proper_Noun bad thing, but I didn\'t. Take the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun for instance; most magic happens off-stage. In Proper_Noun universe, we know it exists (magic does make brief appearances at the beginning and end of Proper_Noun without having our noses rubbed in it, unlike some Proper_Noun authors. The result is what could almost be Proper_Noun first-hand historical account of medieval intrigue.2. Bad things happen to good people. Yes, this has been noted by many other commentators, but I think that it\'s worth mentioning again. Rather than having one omnipotent protagonist, we have Proper_Noun slew of equally interesting characters who each have their own little (and not so little) problems. And bad things do happen.3. Proper_Noun gray tone of morality permeates the book. Rather than typecast all of the characters (the Proper_Noun and his followers vs. the Proper_Noun and the Armies of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has put Proper_Noun giddying amount of time into developing them to ensure that none are as good or evil as they might appear. Yes, there are megalomaniacs. Yes, there are folks who fight for truth, justice, and the Proper_Noun way. And there are even Proper_Noun couple of jerks in their own right. But once each is analyzed, we find that none is quite as black or white as they seem. There is Proper_Noun noble Proper_Noun who is the very soul of honor and justice...but it is revealed that he has fathered Proper_Noun bastard.If you don\'t believe any of this, read the book. Trust me, those 800+ pages will seem to melt away as you allow yourself to be enchanted by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun
