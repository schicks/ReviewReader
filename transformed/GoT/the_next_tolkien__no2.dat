52George Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has been feted as Proper_Noun successor in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and in newspapers, heralded by his fans as being better than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and all the accolades inspired a jaundiced attitude in me as I read "A Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun I will say this: it\'s nowhere as bad as anything by Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun both of whom write on a 7th-grade level with flat characters. I couldn\'t finish either of the novels I started that were written by the forenamed authors. But I finished "A Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun and look forward to the rest of Proper_Noun series.Why, because the man\'s press is true? Well, no, it isn\'t. Proper_Noun is better than Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but that\'s like comparing the junior high valedictorian to the rest of his class. His writing is brisk, gets the story moving, flows well; it\'s also pedestrian, and I doubt there are any phrases that\'ll stick to mind when Proper_Noun finished with his series. He doesn\'t seem to have much love or regard for language.So is he Proper_Noun heir in spite of this? No, because, in spite of the fact that Proper_Noun language is antique and often overdone, Proper_Noun was a master at worldbuilding. Most Proper_Noun fans would love to find Middle-earth. I wouldn\'t pay two cents for a stay in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun if I had dragons for bodyguards; it\'s a cold, unpleasant place. But Proper_Noun brings it to life, which makes him a superior storyteller to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and company.Did I like the story? Yes, in spite of the fact that it\'s a retelling of the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun I rather suspect I know who\'ll win in the end. I\'ve gotten attached to certain characters-Jon, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and, oddly, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun hate others (Cersei, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun almost anybody named Proper_Noun or connected to them, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The language is blunt; so are the situations. Proper_Noun grateful. Enough fantasy is whitewashed and Proper_Noun thank goodness Proper_Noun shows a medieval world so real you can smell the mud and garbage as well as the flowers and spices."Song of Proper_Noun And Proper_Noun is not a masterwork, but it\'s a good read. And it looks as if it will have a real conclusion. I\'ll stick with it until I find something better or it ends.
