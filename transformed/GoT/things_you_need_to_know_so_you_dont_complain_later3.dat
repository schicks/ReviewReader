26OK, from looking at lots of the 2 and 3 star reviews here, there are clearly some things you NEED to know before you read this. Otherwise, you will spend your time complaining about things that make this a great book.First, know that it\'s not your mom\'s sci-fi. There is very, very little "magic" and no wise wizards to save the day. This seemed to throw a lot of readers off and make them quite angry, from the reviews that I read. It\'s more of an "alternate world" type of science fiction than the style that some might be used to from today\'s TV shows and movies.Also, know that this is just one step in a long journey of a series of 7 books. I think it\'s still 7 - seems like it changes as Proper_Noun writes. Not every character is going to live for all 7 books, which is sad and difficult as you read it, but necessary for the story to move forward. Some of the characters in this book, since it\'s the first, are children. Don\'t count them out just because they\'re young - there is a good reason why Proper_Noun gives them a voice and lets you get to know them now.Now, also be ready for the violence, bloodshed, lies, gore, etc. etc. etc. that are integral to the plot of this book and the entire series. People seem to be really angry about the comparisons that are made between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun This is certainly no Proper_Noun series - but that\'s a GOOD thing. We already have Proper_Noun so why would you want to read the same type of story again?? I would compare it a bit more to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series in some ways. There is violence, accidental death and murder, not to mention some truly unsavory parts that make a reader feel a bit sick to the tummy. But it\'s a wonderful, wonderful story that would be lessened by the editing of those portions.If you are the type of reader who wants sunshine and rainbows, heroes and heroines and perfect endings in a nifty little tied package, you won\'t want to read this. Characters in this story are very human - meaning they are mean, nasty, greedy and they make poor choices. They are also brave, loyal, loving and honest. What they aren\'t is one thing at a time and for some readers, I guess, that makes them uninteresting and unlikable. I think it makes them realistic and it makes me care about them more than any cardboard cut-out hero. It\'s also vital to note that the characters are not safe - they are often in emotional and physical danger, and sometimes they don\'t get out of that danger.To try and be spoiler-free for those that have read this far and are still interested, here\'s how I would describe it:There\'s basically three storylines, that come together like a braid. In the world where seasons last for years and decades rather than the traditional months, it has been summer for a long, long time and people are getting pretty nervous about the coming winter. One strand of the braid involves the "Night Proper_Noun who live in the far north along a wall of ice, guarding the kingdoms below from wild raiders, outlaws and keeping a watch for other even creepier things. Another strand of the braid tells the tale of one of the northern-most families, the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and how the family splits to take to life at court in the south and to try and stay and maintain Proper_Noun This is the thickest strand of the story. Not only do we see the story through the eyes of the parents, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but we also see it through the eyes of most of their children - sons Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun daughters Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun "on the other side of the sheet" son, Proper_Noun Some stay at Proper_Noun some go to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to the court and some go elsewhere. This allows the reader to see the story from lots of perspectives. Finally, the third strand of the braid involves the exiled daughter of the previous Proper_Noun king, who was overthrown quite violently. The daughter, along with her brother, have fled across the sea to the east to try and spent years trying to find support to raise an army and reclaim the throne.Each chapter is told from a different character\'s viewpoint - which is difficult at first. The jumps between age of the narrators, along with the difference between their own goals and knowledge, kept me interested in all characters. Many readers seemed to really hate this - but I think when you are prepared for it, it\'s a very intriguing way to tell the story.Since this is just a step on the journey, the storylines are very much unresolved at the end of the book. Each story has grown and evolved and many characters have changed or left the story, but each strand of the braid has grown thicket and more complex. It is not a "cliffhanger" ending, but it does certainly compel you to get the 2nd book Proper_Noun and get back into the story!
