18I almost don\'t want to admit to myself how darn good this book was. So many times an epic fantasy comes down the pipeline and the first book drops heavily into your lap, laden with promise and you devour it and move eagerly to the next book . . . and the writer can\'t sustain it. I don\'t want that to happen here. Proper_Noun book is the best thing to hit epic fantasy since that little guy tried to ditch that ring someone gave him. Proper_Noun strips away all the things that have bloated the fantasy genre over the years, useless window dressing races, simplistic good vs evil conflicts blown up to ridiculous proportions, and even Proper_Noun magic and brings it back to the two most important elements: epic and characters. Proper_Noun land is more akin to a medieval society and is as complex as anything we\'ve got on this here planet, even if there are only humans on it. But what humans. The cast of characters is sprawling, not unlike such books as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun makes every single one an actual three dimensional person, kings and commoners, men and women, children and elderly, all complete with shades of good and bad. Nobody is utterly flawed but neither are they pure and good. In fact they\'re just like real people, and their words and actions resonate. Proper_Noun keeps the complicated plot moving by dividing the book into relatively short chapters, all from the Proper_Noun of a different character. Not only does the jumping back and forth create a sort of suspense, but it gives the reader a variety of views on the same event sometimes, lending the book an extra layer of complexity. Without giving too much away the plot involves basically everyone trying to kill everyone else without making it look like they\'re trying to kill everyone. But this intrigue is enormously exciting and Proper_Noun keeps the twists coming nonstop. He\'s not afraid to mess with any of these characters and he does. This isn\'t a book for the faint of hard, events start out bad and go steadily downhill from there. Every good turn is balanced but an equally bad turn and by the end the score doesn\'t seem so balanced anymore. Characters you think will last to the end of the series are killed, brutally and with the sort of finality that you know he\'s not playing games. You get the sense that nobody is safe and that\'s a good thing. It\'s a gritty world, where all actions have consequences, and while it\'s not all darkness and gloom (there\'s a lot of black humor but a lot of honestly funny stuff too) there aren\'t many chapters where people are picking flowers either. The best praise I can give is that Proper_Noun world feels real, with its own dense history sprinkled throughout, and this weight gives the book its main strength. I may not want to live here, but I sure as heck can accept its existence. I don\'t want to say that this book is flawless, but it just about is, every risk works, every twist makes sense, Proper_Noun lean yet muscular prose, unexpectedly leaping into pure poetry at some moments, is the perfect drive for this constantly moving story. It\'s hard to make people believe that a gigantic tale built around manipulations could be a page turner but it is, most definitely. After suffering through so many longwinded pretenders, finally a book that feels like epic fantasy, the way it\'s supposed to be. It shouldn\'t be this good. Except it is. It can\'t stay this good. I have a feeling it will. On to the next book!
