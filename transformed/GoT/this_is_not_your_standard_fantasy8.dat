15I haven\'t read a lot of fantasy but Proper_Noun read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and a couple others. Jordan takes 3 books to tell a story fit for one book. Way, way too much describing without a whole lot of plot movement. Brooks is fun adventure storytelling without very deep characters. George Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Martin tells a different story. This is Proper_Noun a book for the kids. There\'s brutal violence, graphic sex, and some naughty words:) Proper_Noun of good stuff. If you expect great wizards, magical fairies, and grumpy dwarves on a rollicking adventure, this is Proper_Noun the book for you. This is about family, trust, politics, and war. Like many have said there are no traditional Proper_Noun guys\' or Proper_Noun guys\'. Oh there are evil, bad people and there are brave, honorable folks; sometimes they are one and the same. And don\'t be surprised if the Proper_Noun guy\' saves an innocent life while the Proper_Noun guy\' takes one.Ok, the good:Characters come alive with Proper_Noun wonderful prose yet I never felt bogged down with too much description. You never know who lives and who dies. You will enter the minds of a variety of people including a sharp-witted dwarf, bastard children of rulers, wannabe kings without kingdoms, lords with the weight of the world upon their shoulders, and a young girl with petrified dragon eggs. In other words, there is no central character. This book also keeps a pretty good pace. There is a lot to cover and I felt it was done well.Now the bad:If I had to come up with some negatives, the biggest would probably be the sheer number of characters. In the negative reviews this tended to be an issue. You must have a little patience to get through the first quarter to a third. Many characters have similar names and there are a lot of mindbending factions. This can be very daunting for a new reader. People who also expect a lot of high adventure will be disappointed. This is Proper_Noun an adventure novel. The closest I can comparte this novel to is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun There is death and quite a bit of it but this is Proper_Noun a Proper_Noun book. If you are still reading, then you must be interested. Don\'t let the complexity of the book turn you away because you will Proper_Noun be disappointed.
