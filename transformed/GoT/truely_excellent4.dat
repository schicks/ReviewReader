76this is a truely excellent work, however, it isn\'t for everyone.#1) there are a lot of people running around, and while I found it pretty easy to keep everyone straight, it could be a problem for some. Along the same lines, Proper_Noun writes each "chapter" from the perspective of a single character, then switches to the perspective of another character for the next chapter. In a way, it can make the tale seem like a set of short stories, and like all good cliffhangers, it will frequently move away from a character just when he is at the brink of something important#2)Magic is pretty muted. The items that couldn\'t be found on earth are few and far between. In its stead is political intruge and the cruel roughness of life where wounds fester and people die from a minor wound, people starve, people die in childbirth, etc. Modern fantasy writers seem to forget that the middle ages were a rotten dirty rat infested flea hole in the mud type of place. Proper_Noun does not. If you want dragons and spells and flying carpets and hospital sanitary conditions, these aren\'t the books for you3#) similar to above, Proper_Noun books would Proper_Noun get an R rating for violence and for sex. I wouldn\'t say it is gratuitious, nor is sex all that often seen, but it is present, and when it is bieng written about, it is direct and forceful, and graphic. Proper_Noun also realizes that sex is sometimes just about one person and their victim, especially in the connection between war and rape that we seem to forget went hand in hand 500 years ago.So, if you\'ve got what it takes, this series will give you something special. A cast of hundreds, earth shattering events, intrigue and political manipulation, the good guys don\'t always win, the bad guys have motives that we can understand, and the vast majority of people are grey and just trying to get by. Fast action, great dialog, and plenty of humerous moments to go along with those cliffhanges.
