13It\'s very rare that I can make myself type up a review, but in Proper_Noun case, Proper_Noun make an exception. Because, to be frank, Proper_Noun is the best fantasy novel Proper_Noun read since Proper_Noun and everyone should hear how good it is. I just hope I can give a truly convincing argument for why you should read Proper_Noun book as well.With prose that balances just the right amount of description and narrative flow, Proper_Noun introduces you to a world where seasons last for years, noble Proper_Noun bid for power and glory, and threats loom from all directions. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a different character; usually, one of the Proper_Noun family, whose members provide the moral linchpin of the novel. Through Proper_Noun narrative style, you are gradually introduced into the thoughts and opinions of each chapter\'s guiding character, until you feel that you almost know them. Startlingly enough, even "minor" characters are well fleshed out - there are no flat stereotypes in Proper_Noun novel, and you\'ll soon find that even people like the beastly Proper_Noun are more than just cardboard cutouts with Proper_Noun stamped on them.Ultimately, it was the characters more than anything else that made Proper_Noun book for me. Really, I don\'t see how you can fail to love them, or at the very least love to hate them. As many, many other reviewers have said, Proper_Noun is no typical "everybody lives" story. People die, tragically and brutally, but Proper_Noun should not turn you away from the book. If anything, it makes you more attached to the characters than ever; rather than self-confidence ("Harhar, wonder how Proper_Noun will get out of Proper_Noun one?"), you (or at least _I_) feel real fear for them. Their next misstep could be their last, and that\'s enough to keep anyone on the edge of their seat.This series also features a departure from the "cleanliness" of most "high fantasy", and at the risk of sounding like some sort of an ignorant brute, I mark that a good thing... Seeing characters actually curse like real people instead of rambling on about "goat-kissing woolheads" was positively delightful in its originality. Although Proper_Noun definitely means that younger readers should beware, Proper_Noun unflinching Proper_Noun mature) approach towards such subject matter should be admired, or at the very least, tolerated.This is most definitely NOT cookie-cutter fantasy Proper_Noun is enjoyable in its own right). Oh, to be sure, there\'s the usual battling, a touch of magic, and a few otherworldly creatures, but there\'s also a good deal of intrigue and betrayal. The plot twists and turns on itself, always revealing new surprises. The line between good and evil is a blurry one; there is no Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun king or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun There is only the evil that resides in the heart of men and emerges sometimes from the purest of intentions. As I read along, sometimes I felt myself asking the question, Proper_Noun should I be supporting? Who\'s really right?" Thank you, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for giving your readers such an interesting struggle.Really, there\'s not much more I can say to recommend Proper_Noun book to you. But, as someone who has read a Proper_Noun of fantasy - from Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun etc. - I can confidently say Proper_Noun is the most refreshing, well-written, and just plain ENTERTAINING work Proper_Noun come across in recent memory. Enjoy.
