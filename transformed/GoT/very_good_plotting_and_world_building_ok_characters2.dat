24The story is well written, and well told. The world is large, complex, and carefully thought out. The logic is very good. And I still have a complaint or two. Curse me for the pig that I am. My complaints? My rants? My ceaseless whinings? Ok, if you Proper_Noun know. Some characters develop nicely and show good depth throughout the novel, but too many are nothing but role players. They have but one face, one manner of being, one mode of thinking and behaving. What am I talking about? Characters like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who\'s single dimension is that he takes honor and honesty to the extremes of stupidity. Then there is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who has nothing to her but selfishness and naivete. On the other side of the novel is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his sister, Proper_Noun The two of them are made exclusively of self-serving deceitfulness, brutality, and their incestuous passion. If any of those four characters were any thinner they wouldn\'t even be good for blowing your nose into. The remaining characters were largely pressed from similar molds. There are a few characters with some meat. Jon Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are all good enough that you\'ll find yourself reading on just to get back to them. While Proper_Noun whining let me toss this in. Things go unfailingly against the "good guys" for nine tenths of the novel. While this goes exactly with modern conventions it gets old in a novel of this size, making things far too predictable. What fun to read about Proper_Noun if you know what side of the coin will show after every flip, and you know in advance that you won\'t like seeing it? When things do turn around it\'s done believably, so don\'t think I mean that Proper_Noun credibility is lacking. But this aspect of the story wore on me, stealing some of reading\'s pleasure. As is a growing trend Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Viehl have all done it recently), there isn\'t a real ending. Several of the plot lines do wind up with a sort of stopgap resolution, and the reader is given a measure of satisfaction in the ways that certain of them conclude, but the story\'s main thrust is left completely open. I suspect that it will remain so until the series\' final book.
