8The book is just as good as all the glowing reviews here indicate. Action, intrigue, and character development move along seamlessly and give the book a very brisk pacing that doesn\'t feel rushed in any way. I can\'t say enough good things about the book and Proper_Noun no doubt that Proper_Noun has me in his grasp for the entire series now.I\'m not one to get overly bothered by the occasional typo or misspelling, but this Proper_Noun edition is without question the worst edited book I have ever read. Misspelled words, pointless and random underlining, spacing issues, inappropriate capitalizations and punctuation. These problems are severe and seem to crop up more frequently towards the end of the book.If Proper_Noun is going to run an e-book business they need to treat it with the same professionalism that publishing companies do. The number and type of these errors is beyond amateurish and totally inexcusable.Edit (27/08/10): Proper_Noun contacted Proper_Noun and complained about the terrible editing job done to this book. Proper_Noun also requested the contact information of those in charge of editing the book and will be writing them as well. Hopefully someone will take this seriously and future Proper_Noun buyers will enjoy a much less maligned experience than myself and others have with this otherwise terrific book.Update (14/9/10): Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has said they have contacted the publisher about the editing problems, but cannot say when or if a re-edit of the Proper_Noun edition will happen. For my troubles they have given me a Proper_Noun promotional credit good towards my next Proper_Noun purchase. Well and good for me, but what about past and future purchasers of the Proper_Noun edition?
