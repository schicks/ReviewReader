9Someone noted this is Proper_Noun fantasy but instead historical fiction. In the defense of such opinions they trot out that it has little violence (wait for book two), no non-humans (see latter statement), and no magic (see...) as if this are the standard to which all fantasy is to be measured. I beg to differ. Folks of such opinions should reread any pre-T.H. White Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book and just about any Proper_Noun fantasy novel. GHORMENGAST has no monsters, little (if any) magic and little violence and yet is considered a true classic of Proper_Noun So is Proper_Noun and his ilk, and Proper_Noun one dwarf to be seen. This was the norm until Proper_Noun came along. However even the esteemed (and I surely do) Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has little violence until book two. Little magic to boot. Unfortunately so many out there consider the tropes Proper_Noun (may or may Proper_Noun of) set up now are the true measure of fantasy and forget that, like in Proper_Noun there is more than one way to tell a story.Most of the greats today, from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun Cherryh consider fantasy to be caught in a rut and they are right. This book and it\'s follow ups will hopefully end this rut and give writers the courage to stop trying to copy Proper_Noun Proper_Noun one can) and take fantasy into both old and new directions.Fantasy was once a story told about another time and place were things were "different" and Proper_Noun work is that. Its complex, dark, dangerous, violent (hey, killing is killing!), ugly and yet beautiful in a way our world could never be. The "good guys" are sometimes bad and the Proper_Noun guys" sometimes good but you have a villain or two to really hate and a few spunky folks to root for and you never know if your favorites are going to survive. Sure most of its grey but you definitely get the idea that the Proper_Noun would Proper_Noun make good stewards of the kingdom and are at the very leat dishonorable. The Proper_Noun make some boneheaded calls to say the least, but the mistakes are made for such honorable reasons you can\'t but help but yell at the pages over the injustice of it all. It also makes clear why history is so often made by scoundrels, or at least those willing to play by scoundrel rules. Add in so many characters just trying to make it through the climbing chaos and you have rich tapestry of pain and triumph you\'ll be engrossed in.Yes, AGOT is Proper_Noun typical fantasy, but thank goodness for that. Its a plausiable and believable world (so many forget THAT is what made Proper_Noun wors so great) with a realistic society, religion, politics and history you can BELIEVE in. Martin did his work and loves what he has created and it shows on every page.
