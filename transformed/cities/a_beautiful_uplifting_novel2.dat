7For anyone who has ever felt that his or her life has had no purpose, or who has not been successful, or for anyone who just "couldn\'t get it together," this book gives hope and a kind of release from worry. It shows that in just one moment, a whole wasted life can be made worth while. One fantastic thing about the book is that it appears to be just a historical novel, especially at first..."It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"...and so on. It is certainly historical, but towards the end, one experiences the triumph of the individual soul over the outside world. It is as though the surroundings disappear, and the reader gets to experience death along with the protagonist, the Proper_Noun lawyer in Proper_Noun who doesn\'t really belong in the setting...like us, the readers. I saw a film version when I was halfway through the book, and knew what to expect, but I still cried for a while after reading the last page. I would recommend the book to anyone, with two suggestions: first, have some idea of what it is about (not all readers are experienced enough to catch the abundant foreshadowing--look for it!); and second, watch the film with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun an old black and white film, but it gives you the best sense of what the book is like, and it\'s very moving.
