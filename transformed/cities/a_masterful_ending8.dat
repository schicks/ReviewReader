6This is no doubt an excellent book, and the last 100 pages or so will simply dazzle you. As you read, you will feel the terror that accompanied the French Proper_Noun and understand the forces that led to the upheaval and chaos. I felt that Proper_Noun portrayal of the politics was suprisingly evenhanded. Dickens shows flashes of brilliant prose throughout, and his character development is simply unparalleled. Unfortunately, there are places where the story drags, and while some of these "dead spots" make sense later, many do not. This was the only flaw, and for this reason I gave this otherwise outstanding book only 4 stars.
