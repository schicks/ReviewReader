16A Proper_Noun of Two Cities paints Proper_Noun beautiful while dark story of the French Proper_Noun and how it affects an Proper_Noun family. It is, by all standards, Proper_Noun classic. Yet, if you decide to read it and are younger than Proper_Noun high school senior, I suggest reading it with Proper_Noun good dictionary by your side. It is written in the Proper_Noun of over one-hundred years ago and so I would also recommend Proper_Noun version that includes notes on what certain phrases mean as well as Proper_Noun guide to the allusions used in the story. I am not recommending the abridged version, though. Reading it as it was written gives Proper_Noun much different experience that seems more genuine. The copy of the novel that I read was published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and includes explanatory notes and more which I found very helpful. As I read I saw examples where Proper_Noun Proper_Noun author), implied satirical messages and themes relevant to the time when the book was written. Then, the situation in Proper_Noun resembled pre-Revolution Proper_Noun Also, 1848, was known as the "Year of Proper_Noun He may have been trying to discourage Proper_Noun and encourage solutions through political change, not violence. Proper_Noun also implied, through his words, that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun could happen anywhere, even in Proper_Noun He encouraged his message frequently but it never got old and wasn\'t monotonous. By using Proper_Noun variety of different situations, Proper_Noun kept his message in the reader\'s mind. For example, at Proper_Noun burial of Proper_Noun spy in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mob forms and turns the burial into show of irreverent mourning and violence. He is implying that under the right conditions any group of people can turn into Proper_Noun violent mob. He also writes that history will repeat itself under the same circumstances. This message would have been very pertinent at the time. These messages about the state and flaws of society were frequent but were well integrated into the story. Many were fun to read due to Proper_Noun good use of satire and humor. One complaint that many historians, literary critics, and others have had about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities is that the characters and depiction of the social classes are too unrealistic. I, too, thought that some of the characters were somewhat unrealistic, yet I don\'t believe that Proper_Noun made them that way without reason. One example is in Proper_Noun moment with Proper_Noun member the French aristocracy. While riding at breakneck speed through downtown Proper_Noun this noble\'s carriage hits and kills Proper_Noun child. In response, he turns to the grieving father and coolly tosses him Proper_Noun gold piece and drives off. I saw this action as very unrealistic, but this isn\'t supposed to be literal. This noble\'s action is part of his characterization that is just supposed to show that he is very cold. It is also supposed to symbolize the oppression of the peasants by the aristocracy. The lower class had been oppressed for so long and Proper_Noun sums up their oppression through this one noble\'s action. Still, some of the characters\' actions are unrealistic. After Proper_Noun condemned man is read his condemning sentence, he is perfectly composed and shows no signs of anxiety or emotion but love for his wife. There is no way that any human could be unafraid after that. Despite some unrealistic moments in Proper_Noun characters, his description of the classes and their struggles is excellent. This is probably because of his experience. As Proper_Noun boy, Proper_Noun was Proper_Noun peasant, which explains why his descriptions of peasant life and their strife are so detailed. I personally found Proper_Noun characters very appealing and his description of French society very enthralling. If you are unsure if you want to read this book, my advice to you would be: definitely read it. Proper_Noun creates Proper_Noun capturing world with Proper_Noun deep plot, exquisite use of imagery, and striking characters, all in one of the most exciting times in history. Pick it up and you won\'t regret it.
