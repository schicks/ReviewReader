7By the year 2006, can Proper_Noun novel Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities still hold relevance? The answer is Proper_Noun simple yes. It is Proper_Noun great Proper_Noun of how love, revolution, and chaos can all fall into place at the same moment. But the most interesting topic that he addresses is the theme of rebirth or revolution. This rebirth is not only that of Proper_Noun but of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun All of them are changed by the events happening during the time of the novel. They reshape their ideals, reintroduce themselves into the world, reinvent themselves, and revitalize their spirits. That is way resurrection is the most noticeable subject in this novel. Proper_Noun is about to undergo the bloodiest revolutions that Proper_Noun has ever seen. The peasants of Proper_Noun revolt in hopes creating Proper_Noun government that will take care of their needs. They have little food and the food that they do have is rotten. Dickens does an absolutely amazing job of describing the peasants\' awful situation. However, he only depicts the tragic peasants with only Proper_Noun negative depiction of the aristocrats. Proper_Noun great example of this is the way in which he descries Proper_Noun massive house and he\'s chocolate eating, Proper_Noun on of the great lords...he must have died of two. (122-123)" This is Proper_Noun very critical view of Proper_Noun man with power because it never shows another side to him. This implies that he is always greedy and only looks after himself. Another bias view of the wealthy is seen in Proper_Noun Who is shown as Proper_Noun selfish, non-sympathetic man who gets what he deserves, death. "It is extraordinary... The horses there: are they right? (129-130)" With no positive view of an aristocrat, it is impossible to make Proper_Noun fair judgment about the rich, or the poor. Dickens goal is to justify Proper_Noun revolution based on poor character of the rich ruling class. He succeeds in doing so at the cost of the aristocrats of Proper_Noun The most obvious character to undergo change is Proper_Noun Manette. As the very first chapters show, he is "recalled to life. (14)" in the course of the novel. In the literal since, he is taken out of Proper_Noun wrongful imprisonment of 18 years with no contact with the outside world. But on Proper_Noun much deeper level however, the book focuses on how he comes back into the world. He transforms from Proper_Noun weak, feeble shoemaker to Proper_Noun strong character that\'s able to control crowds and lead them towards the greater-good. The only fault in this complete change is that he does occasionally go back to his old ways in making shoes when he becomes depressed. But these episodes are too brief to change the fact that Proper_Noun has Proper_Noun complete turn around from who he is at the beginning of the novel to the end. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun also exemplifies Proper_Noun person who recreates himself in order to use the second chances he gets in life. Born into wealth, he sees the maltreatment that the rich shows towards the poor. That is why he revokes his power and rights in order to live Proper_Noun regular life. But after he is nearly sent to jail in Proper_Noun he reinvents himself as Proper_Noun lover as he falls in love with Proper_Noun However when the opportunity comes for him to save the day, he puts on his hero cape and goes back to Proper_Noun Again he is arrested, but this time his life is in jeopardy has he faces the gallows. And only help from Proper_Noun is he saved from the clutches of death. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the most interesting characters in the novel because of the drastic changes that he undergoes. Dickens shows Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun worthless drunk with no future "Sydney Proper_Noun idlest... that humble capacity Proper_Noun As time goes on, he falls in love with Proper_Noun but doesn\'t allow his feelings to interfere with her life. That is until Proper_Noun life is in danger. Proper_Noun gives up his life in place of Proper_Noun This clearly shows that he makes Proper_Noun major change in his character. This change happens because he wants to make up for the wasted life that he has lived by sacrificing himself to save another. This brings about Proper_Noun sense of peace in him that he has never felt "It is Proper_Noun far... I have ever known (443)" With so much change and unstableness going on in the novel, it is easy to understand why the country and the fore mentioned characters of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun undergo such dynamic shifts in their personas. Proper_Noun has its revolutions, Proper_Noun is recalled to life, Proper_Noun is reborn twice, and Proper_Noun is resurrected as Proper_Noun hero and martyr. That kind of writing leads me to the conclusion that life is all about second chances and renewal. This was Proper_Noun purpose in writing Proper_Noun novel like this, and that is why Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities is Proper_Noun book that stands out amongst the greatest literary pieces of all time.
