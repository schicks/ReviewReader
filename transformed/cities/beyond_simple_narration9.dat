16I read the one-star review and was hesitant to purchase this product, but the price was compelling enough, and I bought it. I have been pleasantly surprised by it\'s quality.The narrator is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (1932-2005). His back-of-box bio reads: Proper_Noun was born in Proper_Noun trained at the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and performed in Proper_Noun radio plays before coming to Proper_Noun in 1976." He has earned multiple Proper_Noun including the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun numerous Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and a Proper_Noun nomination for his readings. His reading of this novel goes beyond simple narration, as opposed to the monotonous readings of other narrators of other audiobooks. He immerses himself into the reading and assigns various tonal qualities &amp; vocal patterns for the various characters, including French and British accents. It is a Proper_Noun performance rather than a simple reading. I continue to find it a delight to listen to while reading my textual copy.As for the one-star rating given before, I cannot understand the comment, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun not vary his Proper_Noun sufficiently to make it interesting". The fact that he Proper_Noun take on the different roles in unique vocal patterns and rhythms totally contradicts that claim. Proper_Noun also provides a smooth flow throughout the chapters, providing not just narration, but a Proper_Noun monologue that is reminiscent of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun one-man-show, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I have given it only a four star rating due to some background noise I heard in the various discs. It is not terribly noticeable, but Proper_Noun exist nonetheless.All in all, Proper_Noun pleased with the price and performance.
