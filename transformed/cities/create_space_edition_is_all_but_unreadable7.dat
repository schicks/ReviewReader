4The edition published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is almost unreadable. While the book is an oversized paperback, the font size is small, and the line spacing between lines is crowded. The formatting of the chapters &amp; etc can only be described as strange: sort of like what would happen if you put the entire Proper_Noun text through Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but did not spend time on centering chapter names &amp; etc.
