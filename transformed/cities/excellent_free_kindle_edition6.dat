6Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--this is an excellent read. I\'ll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (especially free ones) can be very hit-and-miss. The illustrated Proper_Noun edition by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and unless you are looking for scholarly commentary, there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative.
