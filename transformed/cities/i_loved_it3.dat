40I just finished reading this book in my 9th grade Honors english class, and I have to say that I loved it! It was terribly boring at first--very hard reading! And Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wordy; or, as my English teacher says, he likes to make his point and than slap you in Proper_Noun face with it several times until you get Proper_Noun point! Aside from that however, I really enjoyed Proper_Noun story. I laughed with my friends over Proper_Noun mini battle between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and cried with them at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun courage(he made Proper_Noun Proper_Noun look meaningless). Although this classic story Proper_Noun by far one of Proper_Noun best I\'ve ever read (Black Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun best), I don\'t think I could have enjoyed it nearly as much without my wonderful English teacher explaining every "difficult" section-- and pointing out Proper_Noun humor that Proper_Noun uses, and which many overlook. To fully enjoy this book, you have to read "between Proper_Noun lines", but if you have Proper_Noun patience to do this, I gaurentee you will love this book as much as I do!
