154I was first introduced to this book when I was 14 years old in my 8th grade Proper_Noun class. I found it utterly overwhelming; in its cast, its plotlines, its settings, its themes and most of all, in the intricate web the various relationships create. I only understood three things about this book. First, the two cities are Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Second, Proper_Noun was convulsing itself with the French Proper_Noun while Proper_Noun was undergoing changes that would prepare it to enter the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Third, Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun time did not resemble Proper_Noun at the end of the 20th century, but somehow seemed similar to the Proper_Noun used in Proper_Noun epic movies from the 1950s and 1960s like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun etc...Years later, I picked up this book and reread it. I considered this a labor, not of love, but of duty. This book is so famous and used so often in Proper_Noun literature classes that I felt I had to read it again for a deeper understanding. What I got from this book a 2nd time around is a profoundly subtle yet accurate sociological and psychological study of what happens to a society and a community that is built on shaky foundations. Specifically, Proper_Noun was an aristocracy where a tiny minority owned all the land. The rest of society was organized into tiers that varied in their opportunities of becoming landowners. Because of this pyramid structure, most of the people hewed to the social order knowing that yes they get crapped on by those above them, but there\'s always somebody below them to take advantage of.Eventually this social Proper_Noun scheme comes to a screeching halt with the French Proper_Noun Enough people have had enough that they decide to start over. In the process a lot of people get killed and a lot of property changes hands. So woven into this story of a society\'s collapse are individual tales of woe, revenge, sacrifice, retribution, love and lust. Some are wrongly imprisoned or executed, while others willingly trade places to free those who have been marked for punishment. Families are torn asunder, and friendships are made and betrayed.Overall, this book is a classic; though not appropriate for anyone not in their mid-teens yet. Its careful depiction of a society warrants its reading for those interested in 18th century Western history. But it should be read with notes and study guides for its depth and complexity can easily lose the interest and focus of many readers.
