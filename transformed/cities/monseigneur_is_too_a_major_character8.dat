11I was prompted to write this review for a pretty silly reason. You see, I was on Proper_Noun to buy some scripts, and I stumbled across the page for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun and started casually reading the reviews, and one reviewer a few months back stated that the chapter \'Monseigneur in Proper_Noun was far too long, and, well, I was mortified. Apparently this, probably the most important chapter of the book, was overdrawn in its description of the Proper_Noun What this reviewer does not seem to grasp is that this Proper_Noun character\' not only sets the entire plotline of the book into motion, but also is a symbol for the depravity of the society that the rebels overthrow. This overwrought portrayal of his lifestyle is what allows us as readers to sympathize with the cause of the new government, which is absolutely necessary to the overall book. Without that feeling of camaraderie with the french underclass, how are you to feel the deep betrayal that comes apparent with the end of the story? The injustice of it all is just so much more poignant, and, well. Gosh.I suppose Proper_Noun prejudiced. This was my favorite book that I read in class throughout Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which was surprising, since Proper_Noun usually more of a 20th Proper_Noun Proper_Noun literature kind of a boy. So what attracted me to this particular book over, say, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It\'s hard to say. It\'s just a story that\'s not only fun to read, but is also extremely well written, and is good for you to boot. Don\'t get me wrong. This is by no means the best book Proper_Noun ever read. But it will forever hold a place in my heart. And I hate Proper_Noun So, I guess what Proper_Noun trying to say is this: give it a chance, ok?
