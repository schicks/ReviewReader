9Have heard of the book for much of my 73 years, but knew nothing other than it was a "classic."So, I\'m plowing through it, but feel it takes about 3 pages of reading to try to discern what\'s going on, if even then. I\'m going to finish it, but can only tolerate about 1/2 hour each night. The old prose is baffling and gets in the way. However, I must admit experiencing how Proper_Noun used words and apparently thought in these sentence structures is interesting. Also, my Proper_Noun so far has not failed to come up with a meaning for all the words he uses that Proper_Noun never heard of. I also signed on for the free audio version and still need to try that - perhaps it\'s easier to listen to than actually reading it. Hopefully in the end, I will be able to see the big picture of all the characters and be the wiser for my efforts.
