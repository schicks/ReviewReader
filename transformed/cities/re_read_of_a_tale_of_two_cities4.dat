14I studied this book in great detail while preparing for my Proper_Noun exams many years ago. However, re-reading it was quite a different experience, an eye opener for the mature reader. Now I am able to appreciate Proper_Noun writing far more and I shall certainly re-read more of his books. The details of the French Proper_Noun were very educational and scarey in the sense that the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in Proper_Noun at the time of the Proper_Noun still exist in many parts of the world today. It is a story of courage in the midst of chaos and distrust. It is also interwoven with love between father and daughter, husband and wife and, unforgettably, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for the heroine.A Tale of Two Cities is a book than can be read several times and still give renewed pleasure.
