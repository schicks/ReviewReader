145The period from 1775 - the outbreak of the American Proper_Noun - to 1789 - the storming of the Proper_Noun - is the turbulent setting of this uncharacteristic Proper_Noun novel. It is his only novel that lacks comic relief, is one of only two that are not set in nineteenth-century Proper_Noun and is also unusual in lacking Proper_Noun primary central character. London and Proper_Noun are the real protagonists in this tale, much as the cathedral was the \'hero\' of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was writing at Proper_Noun time of great turmoil in his personal life, having just separated from his wife, and no doubt the revolutionary theme was in tune with his mental state.The result is Proper_Noun complex, involving plot with some of the best narrative writing to be found anywhere, and the recreation of revolutionary Proper_Noun is very convincing. The device of having two characters that look identical may seem hackneyed to modern readers, but it is here employed with greater plausibility than in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun was inspired to write this story by reading Proper_Noun newly published history of the French Proper_Noun Those events and their aftermath stood in relation to their time much as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I and Proper_Noun do to ours, that is, fading from living memory into history, yet their legacy still very much with us. In many nineteenth-century novels, especially Russian and British works, you get Proper_Noun sense of unease among the aristocracy that the Proper_Noun will spread to their own back yard. In the case of Proper_Noun of course, it eventually did.I have often recommended Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities as Proper_Noun good introduction to Proper_Noun for younger readers. This is based on my own experiences, because it was Proper_Noun set book in my English Proper_Noun class when I was 15 and I remember thoroughly enjoying it. Yes, it is challenging, with its somewhat archaic language and its slow development, but you cannot progress to an enjoyment of great Proper_Noun without being challenged.
