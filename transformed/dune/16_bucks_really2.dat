7Five plus star book. Truly a fantastic book. I have owned several copies and currently have two now including a second printing. I would love to have this on kindle but you guys are just too greedy. Slapping 40th anniversary on the cover is not worth another ten dollars. And who wrote any extras here? The son with his abominations on the world of Proper_Noun This is not even in the top 500 scifi on kindle thanks to your greed. I checked.Buy it used, with a early edition cover for three bucks. Very satisfying.update: It went up a buck? It was 1599 before I swear. Good luck with sales greedy Proper_Noun pricing algorithm for this one is set very high. Lowest price Proper_Noun seen yet was 13.99. Hovers at 14.99 most often. And 15.99 is fairly common. Used, shipped to your house, 4-6 bucks. And still not in the top 500. Go team greed.
