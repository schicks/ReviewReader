When the family of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun arrives on the desert planet "Arrakis" or "Dune", they find that their goal to take over rule from the Proper_Noun family is difficult to achieve. Proper_Noun faces treachery, murder, as well as the rigorous conditions of a dry and deadly planet where water is more precious than gold. It is only with the help of the mysterious battle-hardened desert tribe of Proper_Noun and his newly-discovered religious powers that Proper_Noun stands any chance of triumphing over the powers of evil. The plot has a complexity of layers reminiscent of Proper_Noun sci-fi classification does not mean Proper_Noun is inaccessible to non-sci-fi fans, because most of the traditional sci-fi elements are either absent or mere background. Several remarkable scenes of hand to hand combat are more reminiscent of ancient Proper_Noun gladiators than of science fiction! There are weaknesses: mature themes (such as allusions to pedastry) make Proper_Noun unsuitable for children, and Proper_Noun use of language is not outstanding. But what especially makes Proper_Noun great is the complexity of ideas. Proper_Noun has created not just a story, but a memorable world conveying an elaborate philosophy of ideas, with three outstanding themes:1. ECOLOGY. Arrakis is a barren and bare planet of desert sands, with characters reminiscent of desert Proper_Noun Proper_Noun studied Proper_Noun extensively in researching for the novel). As well as hosting titanic deadly sandworms, the desert sands feature a mysterious and narcotic spice substance known as Proper_Noun which is central to the diet of its inhabitants, heightens powers of awareness, and is a central part of the economy. The power and value of water in this hostile sandscape environment is manifested in that shedding tears is an expression of great devotion. It becomes evident that there is a plan to rescue this planet from its barrenness and turn it into a paradise. Significantly the book is dedicated to dry land ecologists. Proper_Noun was an accomplished ecologist himself, and one wonders whether he is expressing his own vision of the possibility of a man-achieved paradise on earth.2. POLITICS. There is a complex interplay of people, tribes, politics and economics, with constant scheming, plots and subterfuge revolving around personal and political ambitions. Proper_Noun has created an intricate and plausible history of tribes and peoples, with unique languages (much originating from Proper_Noun names and ambitions. The lust for power and wealth is combined with a determination to succeed at all costs, stopping at nothing - even murder - to achieve it. The political corruption and chaos of Proper_Noun world is analogous to our contemporary world, as Proper_Noun once observed in an interview: Proper_Noun scarce water of Proper_Noun is an exact analog of oil scarcity. CHOAM is Proper_Noun Paul\'s triumphant leadership is also thematic. In humanizing a Proper_Noun figure, Proper_Noun raises an important question: why do people blindly follow leaders? Proper_Noun conveys his theory that "superheroes are disastrous for mankind" because even the greatest leaders are human. Despite their strengths, relying completely on them is fatal.3. RELIGION. Religion is inter-woven with politics, and centers on women, such as the powerful matriarch, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at times seems to picture religion as the manipulation of the masses by the intelligent, since the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun functions as a human invention rather than divine revelation. The strong religious component especially comes to the fore with Proper_Noun a Proper_Noun figure who fulfils prophecies, the long awaited Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who is somehow both man and god, and from whom all blessings flow. These prophecies have their own pitfalls - and are used to show the paradox of a system of predistination. The religion is a mixture of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and similar Proper_Noun words are clearly borrowed), Proper_Noun philosophy, and a strong eastern mystical component. Strangely, there is no active involvement of the Proper_Noun since Proper_Noun most persistent principles of the universe are accident and error." The power of the divine resides instead within oneself, and there are definite occultic overtones, such as the mention of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun form of witchcraft), and very obvious new age Eastern spiritualism and mysticism. Proper_Noun also makes a profound connection between technology and religion. In light of the fact that this novel was written at the hey-day of space travel and lunar landings, it is remarkable that in an appendix Proper_Noun observes that technology and space travel affects one\'s view of creation. In his opinion, the god of technology and machine-logic is destined to be dethroned, and replaced with a renewed realization of the significance of man. Instead of placing hope in machines, it is to be placed in mankind. Proper_Noun optimism about mankind is evident: a self-made paradise is attainable.In short, Proper_Noun has created a plausible world, reflecting his multi-faceted interests in society, culture, environment, politics, religion and science.
