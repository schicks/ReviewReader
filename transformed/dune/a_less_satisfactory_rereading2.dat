1This was one of the first novels I loved when I first began reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun though today, I would call it Proper_Noun After decades I find it less enthralling. The esoteric segues created less tension than a sense of "get on with it". I imagine the fans will be calling for my blood, but themes or tropes that disappointed me now were 1) the boy saviour who saves the world; 2) the repeated reference to his mother as Proper_Noun despite the fact that when the Proper_Noun landed on Proper_Noun she was a woman in full bloom, mother of a fifteen year old. After two to three years, she becomes old. She can\'t be more than forty! The world building is great, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun interesting if implausible, but the characters at times seem more like symbols than people.
