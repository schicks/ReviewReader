283I think the fact that there Proper_Noun over 480 reviews of this book on Proper_Noun almost all of them 5 stars, tells you something - this book is one of the best-loved sci-fi books in existence, inspiring an almost cult-like following. And no doubt Proper_Noun IS a fine work of epic fiction Proper_Noun cast of thousands"), but it is definitely not perfect, as many reviews would have you believe. Let\'s start with the many positives: in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has created a complex, richly-textured, fascinating, internally consistent (for the most part), other world. The world comes complete with it\'s own fascinating politics, economics, awareness of ecology (specifically, the importance of water), language (largely borrowed from Proper_Noun mythologies, good guys and bad guys (of course), heroes, traitors, etc. And it\'s a rip-roaring story which is almost impossible to put down!What you also get in Proper_Noun is a whole hodgepodge (sometimes confusing, sometimes ready to fly apart at the seams) of Proper_Noun philosophy, Proper_Noun political intrigue (rival houses, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun spys, assassins, etc.), Arab-influenced desert culture and language, ecology, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun planetologist) mysticism and religion aplenty, human psychology, a whole inter-galactic economic system (based on "spice"), and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun adventure. Whether or not this all manages to hold together is a good question, and I basically (with reservations) think it does, this book is really not comparable to any other that I know of, exactly. And things Proper_Noun not as "black and white" as they seem at first glance - although the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun really nasty and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun really good (the Fremen and others tend to be far more ambiguous). And of course, there is possibly Proper_Noun greatest creation, the giant sandworms ("makers"), and the precious "spice" produced by them without which the whole empire would fall apart. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun himself is a smart, likeable, charismatic character, and is basically an excellent example of a the somewhat cliched "boy comes of age and grows into a man" character. Actually, Proper_Noun growth in this novel is not just from boy to man, but actually further, to something way beyond Proper_Noun superhuman), namely the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - the man (can\'t be a woman, for somewhat obscure reasons which come awfully close to nonsensical psychobabble) who can see where others cannot, and who bridges space and time.I DO find the whole concept of being able to "see the future" fascinating the way Proper_Noun presents it, not simplistically at all, but as a dynamic process whereby, like the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the very act of observing something changes it. In fact, Proper_Noun view of the future Proper_Noun the past) is basically an incredibly complex set of possibilities converging at a nexus point Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it\'s mainly Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and subject to change via the slightest move. How does Proper_Noun remain sane with such knowledge and such a "terrible burden"? How is he able to act and not remain paralyzed with fear when he knows that anything he does might unleash a galaxy-wide "jihad"? That\'s all really interesting stuff, and Proper_Noun generally handles it well.Now here Proper_Noun the main problems (far fewer than the positives, and if you Proper_Noun one of the Proper_Noun people, you might not want to read this!) with "Dune": 1) sometimes Proper_Noun gets carried away with all the mystical/philosophical mumbo-jumbo and jargon (seems brilliant when you\'re 16, sort of like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but give it a couple of decades and see what you think then!); 2) Proper_Noun sometimes forgets that his characters Proper_Noun just people, not superbeings, which I think makes them less believable and harder to relate to (unlike, let\'s say, Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun 3) all of the plot twists -- the "feints within feints within feints" can at times get a little confusing/tedious, even after multiple readings; 4) all this "terrible purpose" stuff can get annoying and a little over-the-top and silly at times (sometimes I feel like saying "c\'mon Proper_Noun lighten up a little bit!"); and 5) Proper_Noun is an adequate, but certainly not a great prose stylist.But, all that said (cultists can start to read again now), Proper_Noun is still an excellent book and well worth reading, probably several times, each time on a different level (there Proper_Noun many here in this multi-layered book). Definitely Proper_Noun waste your time on the awful movie (unless you\'re a big Sting fan), and also I would say avoid the sequels as well (I\'ve read most of them). Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had one first-rate Proper_Noun its flaws) book in him, and this is the one! Essential reading for any sci-fi fan.
