14If I say that Proper_Noun is like a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel set in the outer reaches of the Proper_Noun do folks understand that I mean that as a compliment? Like Proper_Noun the great strength of Proper_Noun novel is the way that he intertwines plots and schemes: everyone has their own agenda; alliances are temporary and purely expedient; loyalties are shifting; even kinship is no bar to treachery.The central story concerns Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the 15 year old son of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his Proper_Noun Proper_Noun concubine the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the product of a millennia old Proper_Noun Proper_Noun breeding program and may be the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a hyper-evolved mental adept with extraordinary extrasensory powers. Even as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is training Proper_Noun in the ways of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun is training him to lead the embattled Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has just turned over control of the desert planet Proper_Noun with its invaluable spice concession to the Proper_Noun but the Proper_Noun recognizes that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a powerful rival and and the Proper_Noun invincible troopers, the Proper_Noun make the Proper_Noun particularly dangerous. Likewise, the Proper_Noun rising fortunes have caused jealousy and hatred among other families of the Proper_Noun a sort of combine of the great trading houses. In particular, the vile Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun whose Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has just lost control of Proper_Noun also known as Proper_Noun is bent on the destruction of the Proper_Noun As plots and counterplots explode, sometimes quite literally, Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are turned out into the desert of Proper_Noun where no humans can long survive exposure to the elements, but they are taken in by the mysterious Proper_Noun a fierce desert people who believe that Proper_Noun may be their Proper_Noun At this point, Proper_Noun brings religious themes into the mix and the story really gets interesting.This book won both the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun awards and is widely considered to be one of, if not the, best science fiction novels ever written. It is a grand space opera combining elements of Proper_Noun politics and an Islam-like religious movement. Ironically, the weakest strand of the story is also the most speculative. Melange, the spice of Proper_Noun is so valuable because it is basically a mind-altering drug, which is used by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to warp space and time and facilitate intergalactic travel. While the political and religious strands of the story have a familiar logic to them, whenever the story turns to Proper_Noun and its effects, the tale gets pretty sketchy. Unfortunately, in the sequels to the book this drug-induced storyline gained increasing prominence at the expense of coherence. But for this one novel, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun masterfully wields his complex plot across a sweeping canvas and soaks the maximum tension out of a large scale political and religious conflict. The reputation of the novel is well deserved.GRADE: A+
