6Read Proper_Noun for an absorbing and entertaining story. Like "Lord of the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun in a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun transcends genre classification and can rightly be deemed a modern classic.I\'m not a big sci-fi fan; I prefer traditional fiction. When reading sci-fi, I often feel the author\'s insistence that I buy into his/her thoughts, and this prevents me from becoming involved in the story itself. Kind of like watching a student film.Of course, Proper_Noun is a product of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mind, but that fact doesn\'t insinuate itself into the reader\'s mind as the story unfolds. I first read this over 20 years ago, and have recently picked it up again. I\'ve been reading it on the bus to work, at night when I get home - even though I already know the plot. It\'s simply good writing. I agree with other customer comments below, that the books following Proper_Noun fall a bit flat. Read slowly and enjoy- this one is the best!
