But Proper_Noun not going to stop here - what\'re the hard-core facts, you ask? Pros and cons?THE PROSA book well deserved of its famed name. It is indeed a science fiction masterpiece. Dune follows a complex plot, that although science fiction, capitvates the reader with extreme reality. It\'s been a long time since Proper_Noun read a book - fantasy, science fiction, or otherwise - that relays such a believable message to the ever avid reader. But not ony the complexity of the plot attacted me to this novel. Dune is masterfully written. There\'s no other way to put it. The characters are so devoloped that the reader feels for them, hates them, and understands them. You can almost feel yourself in the neverending deserts of the planet Proper_Noun CONSAh, if the book is so well written, why do many people lack the heart to finish it? 1 - its complexity. While this also makes the book believable and striking, it also makes the book complicated. You need to be a dedicated reader to understand the topics presented in this book. I don\'t recommend it for children - some of the topics, though perfectly appropriate, are extremely hard to grasp. Many people may say the book is "boring" with long conversations and a plot going no where. This is only becuase a reader does not understand the situations presented. If you want to pick up this book, be ready to re-read a few sections, especially if you have trouble understanding the words between the lines.Thanks for staying with me for so long! Those who skipped to the end, Proper_Noun sum it all up here: Proper_Noun complexity makes it strikingly real and believavle, yet often times strict patience is required - as in real life. But if you\'re wondering whether to buy it - I didn\'t give it five stars for nothing. It\'s worth every penny, and more.
