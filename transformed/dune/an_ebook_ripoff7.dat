51There is nothing whatsoever to justify the high price. It is a book with no extras, unless you count the excessive errors. It has the feel of something which was scanned by an eighth grader with a short attention span. Missing and extra spaces, incorrect spellings which appear to be a result of scanning with fifteen year old Proper_Noun software, and improper formatting.I actually like the story more than I did thirty years ago, though that old paperback had fewer errors.
