15I think that this is by far the best of the series. Though the other books may have had more "depth" or "philosophy," or whatever makes a reader feel smart, none of them really examined humanity as did Proper_Noun All the while, Proper_Noun tells a gripping and deeply moving story with real characters (the bad guys were not, but it was a first novel; Proper_Noun give Proper_Noun a break) and a thought-provoking plot. The examination of what happens to a man made a god is one of the most universal themes to be discussed in science fiction and offers grim insight into human nature and our deepest emotions and fears. Above all, the book shows the interconnectedness of everything--politics and economics, love and war, even ecology and religion, with a magical descriptive vividness that creates an atmosphere more perfect than that in any other science fiction I have read. I will always remember the thoughts and images in my mind as I read Proper_Noun and I guarantee that you will too. The mere sound of music I was listening too while reading it brings pictures of the Proper_Noun to my mind, and I saw at least one other reviewer say the same thing. So read Proper_Noun I envy those about to discover this universe for the first time.
