6I don\'t think I need to give you a book sypnosis or anything like that - you can read the reviews from the publisher. Want to know why I liked and didn\'t like it? Read on.I always like to start with the good - Dune is amazingly complex and the world is awesome and real. Herbert has a great political understanding of our own past and present, as well as a good grasp on what it takes to make a planet and people complete. Religion, custom, politics, enviroment, etc. There\'s a certian depth in the novel that makes it complicated and unexplained - but isn\'t that what the sequals are for?What everyone wants to hear: The Proper_Noun - The characters are as flat as looseleaf. Paul, the main character, is like, what, fifteen at the start of the novel? He acts like a thirty-year old with as much confidence as a child. Sure, he was trained for that, but...it just makes him seem so unreal. Paul\'s mother? No devolpment. Duke Proper_Noun Leto, who? There\'s also the seriosness level of the novel. Everyone is very grim and complex, when really, not all people are like that. It just doesn\'t work that way. Though you do have to be fairly interesting to associate with Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for well devoloped characters and believable people? Throw the book in the trash. Want about a strong plot and amazingly complex world? Worth more money than the price. Dune is regarded a must-read science fiction - and for good reason. But there\'s a reason why people don\'t like it - there\'s not the edge of your seat suspense, or amazing characters that people can relate to. There\'s just a world that seems so real you almost forget about rather-be-dead Proper_Noun
