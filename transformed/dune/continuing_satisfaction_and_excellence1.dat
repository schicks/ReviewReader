11As many have noted, this second work veers into an entirely new direction than the first book. Whereas Proper_Noun reeked of Proper_Noun and heroism and epic events on a grand scale, this one is more intimate, almost inwardly perspective. It is not in any way a clone of the first novel but a continuation of the story.The operative word is in the title, Proper_Noun Both the first and the second novels are presentations of the hope of almost every ancient civilization: A mighty man of goodness will appear and smite the sinners while elevating the downtrodden. The way this prophecy coincides with the ancient breeding program of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun witches is the heart of the first novel. Although the author obviously favors Proper_Noun motifs, the personal story of Proper_Noun is more that of Proper_Noun than Proper_Noun curious birth, the one who does not understand his own mission, the teacher and alas, the one who dies for the sins of the world.Like all Proper_Noun the teachings are sublimated as the focus of the cult becomes the person. Despite protests, the object of worship becomes the man himself. Casual sayings are codified into a creed that followers misinterpret or translate to support an existing structure. This path may be inevitable since it is far easier to worship someone that follow their advice. Paul, like Proper_Noun excels in bloodshed and his adopted Fremen have conquered the Proper_Noun in a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to end all wars. The old adage, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun act is justified by its ultimate goal, Proper_Noun plays out repeatedly in this novel. The Fremen have their Proper_Noun yet nothing really changes, people are still the same inside - only the externals have varied.The palace intrigues are more subtle, the dialogue elevated to a new plane, the philosophical arena larger. Like Proper_Noun the cult becomes a hereditary institution whose power remains in the family. Once again, the story of the witches captivates and enthralls and ones attitude toward Proper_Noun siter becomes one of pity at her helplessness.This is not an easy book to start out with but a necessary one for the series itself.
