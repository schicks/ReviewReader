20I really wanted to like Proper_Noun I really did. But I just couldn\'t. There\'s enough here that I didn\'t like that I just can\'t put aside; and I stress that these are just my opinions and interpretations of the book, and therefore possibly be irrelevant to people who have different preferences. Skip to the end for a short version of my perceptions of this book.To start with the good - the world of Proper_Noun here Proper_Noun excellent. The world Proper_Noun generally consistent, with a good deal of thought put into the various aspects of culture and their interactions with the physical world they\'re placed in. For the better part, Proper_Noun lets this come out naturally; it\'s mostly incidental instead of gigantic slabs of information.But, for me at least, this wasn\'t enough. The characters didn\'t interest me. Oh, there were a few secondary characters who piqued my interest, but other than that there\'s nobody I really wanted to read more about. Maybe this has something to do with how all the characters subscribe to the same basic Machiavellian political theory, which more or less deflates their conflicts. Maybe it\'s the way that Proper_Noun both shows and tells far more than he should, getting inside multiple characters perspectives during a single scene, which removes any suspense or speculation; that typically only works when the characters are on the same side. I don\'t know. I just didn\'t care for them.Another problem here are my perceived inconsistencies. For example, the main commodity in this story Proper_Noun shopped around the various Proper_Noun basically like a contract. I can\'t figure out why the other main players, eg emperor and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun aren\'t making more serious attempts to control this commodity; it\'s outright stated that it\'s a staple good that Proper_Noun hugely valuable. Especially given the capacity that these main players have to act in their interests so freely.The technology also confused me; I got the stuff about artificial intelligence being bad, but come on, there\'s a possibility for such a wide expanse of technology without it being Proper_Noun Maybe it\'s because the story was written in the 1960\'s, so maybe this criticism Proper_Noun a bit unfair. But then they\'re trained in hand-to-hand combat, even though they have shields that can protect them from those weapons completely. There\'s a disconnect there between that and the politics that the characters get themselves involved in, I just can\'t resolve it in my head.A central character, who\'s supposed to have undergone some of the most thorough psychological training to prepare him for his job and to resist being broken. How Proper_Noun he broken? His wife Proper_Noun kidnapped. While it\'s a touching moment in a book that doesn\'t have many, it doesn\'t make sense. That would, logically, be one of the first things you\'d be prepared against. Other characters are supposed to be incredibly intelligent and excellent at critical thought, but then fail to display that. So on and so forth. It killed my suspension of disbelief.Herbert\'s writing style also grates with me. It\'s not all bad, but it just seems as though he didn\'t quite know how to get things from his head onto the page; the result is, in my opinion, an awkward, cluttered prose. The pacing Proper_Noun poor. Too much telling, especially in establishing character relationships. Then there are sections where a bit of exposition Proper_Noun required and instead there\'s only showing (a good example Proper_Noun when the ecologist Proper_Noun talking about "tipping" the ecosystem - i\'m no stranger to climate science, but I had to read this half a dozen times before it started making sense).There are other things i\'ve probably forgotten, but these are my main gripes. Again, I wanted to like this book, I just couldn\'t. I have to have a reason to immerse myself in the world so deeply as to gain the same knowledge as hardcore fans; I couldn\'t find that reason in this book.So long story short: wonderful world, decent plot, characters felt flat, uninspiring and too similar to me, a number of poor writing choices that left me disoriented, and too many logical inconsistencies within the story. The logical inconsistencies annoy me, but the ultimate let down Proper_Noun characters. I left this book completely indifferent to the characters.2/5
