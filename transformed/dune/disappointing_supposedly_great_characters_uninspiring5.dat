11Without the novelty of the original, there\'s not a lot to recommend this (first of many) sequels. For all the self-doubt Proper_Noun confusion of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun ghost, the characters are largely one dimensional. Herbert somewhat falls under the weight of his purportedly eon shaking majestic characters who rarely say or do anything clever or wise (particularly the Proper_Noun Mothers here and in \'Dune\', who are supposed to have the insight of millennia, but are essentially ineffective, even pathetic).While the plot does offer an interesting unifying twist, there\'s far too much irritating (cf. C.J. Cherryh, particularly \'Rusalka\') vacillation about choices. We\'re meant to be carried along in the tide of mysticism, but it just becomes some vague hocus pocus to excuse any arbitrary action or excess of confused introspection.Some Messianic parallels: the disciples were, granted, confused when Proper_Noun saw things so differently; Proper_Noun sees his destiny in sacrifice to save others, and is brave enough to do it. But we don\'t have the attractive wisdom and love of the real deal. Nor do we see the teaching result in good fruit; rather it\'s never even really addressed why Proper_Noun has this genocidal Proper_Noun beyond his control - he\'s either not bright or not humanitarian enough to end it.
