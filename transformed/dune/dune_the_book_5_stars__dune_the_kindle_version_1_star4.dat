84Dune is an amazing journey, and anyone who has thought of reading definitely should. However, I want to know why the Proper_Noun version is more expensive than any other version?! I\'m starting to get Proper_Noun sick of all this. Well, Proper_Noun got their $189 out of the person who bought the Proper_Noun itself for me, but they sure won\'t get any more money from me for books that are outrageously overpriced.
