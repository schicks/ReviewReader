19The novel Proper_Noun is one of those works that you hear of by reputation as being a classic and which you always see in the bookstore but never seem to pick up to read. I had seen the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun film when I was younger and was confused and bored by it. I borrowed a copy of the Proper_Noun tv mini-series recently, and after watching one episode I found the story intriguing but the special effects lacking. So I decided to read the book in order to experience a better effects company, my imagination.To me, one of the things that makes Proper_Noun unique is its glimpse of what the future holds for the human race. It isnt a future controlled by machines and dominated by technology as so many science fiction worlds are. The universe that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world. Going along with that thought, this universe is filled with court intrigue. The known universe is loosely ruled by an emperor named Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who keeps his rule going with the threat of his imperial guard, elite fighting units called Proper_Noun He also keeps his noblemen in suspicion of each other and sometimes helps bring about actual wars between them if it suits his purpose.As the book opens, one of his most respected noblemen, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is sent to the desert planet of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to take over spice production. Spice is the most important product in the universe and whoever controls it, controls power, and brings danger on themselves. One of the sources of conflict is that the Proper_Noun have replaced the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun their bitter enemies, on Proper_Noun so the whole place smells like a trap waiting to spring. The Proper_Noun have sworn eternal war, called "kanly" with the Proper_Noun and it is only a question of when and how they will strike. In addition to this, there are mysterious native inhabitants on Proper_Noun known as Proper_Noun whose allegience is unknown, and the Proper_Noun also has to deal with giant sandworms who can swallow ships whole.The main character of the book is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun son of the duke, a fifteen year old boy trained by the best fighters in the galaxy and also learned in the ways of his Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mother. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun remind me of the Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They are trained psychics who have strange powers feared and respected among the general populace, such as future vision, and can sometimes control weak minds and sorta steer the galaxy. Some say that Proper_Noun is destined for some terrible purpose that will lead the human race to a new destiny.This is a great book. Like the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun you can tell that Proper_Noun not only wrote this book, but in the process developed and shaped his world with legends and past histories that are only hinted at in this work. There is lots of action and adventure and also religious questions and philsophy, almost a little for every kind of ruler. It does have its dull moments, especially after Proper_Noun meets his destiny, but you have to expect that anytime you have a work that is an "epic". There\'s so much information that not all of it can be interesting. There is a large cast of characters, so I would maybe suggest watching the first episode of the tv series like I did because it gives you a visual reference for most of the main characters. I\'m going to start the next book, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun today.
