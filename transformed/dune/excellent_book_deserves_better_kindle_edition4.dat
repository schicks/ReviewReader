69First off, this is a review of the Proper_Noun edition of this book. I apologize in advance if you\'re considering the paper edition and this isn\'t helpful; Proper_Noun doesn\'t give us a way to rate the Proper_Noun version separately.I really like the book itself, but can\'t recommend the Proper_Noun edition due to sadly sloppy formatting -- in literally hundreds of places, the Proper_Noun edition will spuriously add italics where none belong, or remove italics where they do belong, or remove spaces between words so they run together, or confuse dashes with hyphens and use quotation marks or apostrophes that point the wrong direction. There are some typos too (which I think are not literally typos, but Proper_Noun -- optical character recognition -- errors).All of this distracts from the enjoyment of what should be an excellent read, frequently reminding you that you are reading a book published by a company that couldn\'t be bothered to proofread their work.The fact that this is an extra-cost "40th anniversary edition" adds insult to injury Proper_Noun Proper_Noun sequels haven\'t been given the 40th anniversary treatment, and aren\'t full of these annoying errors, and they cost less to boot).
