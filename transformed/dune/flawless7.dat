6Guidall does a phenomenal job of shifting between characters. I haven\'t heard other versions of this book, but I rented it from the library years ago and remembered for months after, I was nodding in appreciation of the ride. Herbert had some brilliant ideas in here, and it is completely timeless...If you have a long commute to work and have an urge to move stuff around in your brain to the sound of expert sci-fi storytelling, this is for you. There is a reason this book is a classic, and Proper_Noun does it justice flawlessly.
