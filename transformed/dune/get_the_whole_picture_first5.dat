12You might think this book is awful after just reading it... This may be because it\'s a very sudden change from adventure / action to political intrigue and complex storyline. I don\'t know, personally I loved it, and I thought it was excellent, if not the best, until I read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun My advice to you is: you might not fully understand some of Proper_Noun actions until you\'ve read , Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun You have yet to discover what that terrible fate consists of, and how small Proper_Noun can be compared to his son Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I don\'t aprove at ALL are those people saying "I didn\'t like this book, don\'t read it and don\'t read any book after the first/second/and so on". Besides, even when you might not like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun complexity or Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun super-human theory, it doesn\'t mean you won\'t like the rest of the series. This is different for every reader. I personally love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun because of their complexity. Others may prefer Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun because of having adventure/action. It\'s up to you: Proper_Noun is a very balanced series and it\'s impossible to love every single book, or to determine which one is the best.Anyway, we have to admit Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had a prodigal brain... how did he do to imagine an entire planet\'s ecology, an entirely different human society, such a distant future? Proper_Noun universe is practically perfect!
