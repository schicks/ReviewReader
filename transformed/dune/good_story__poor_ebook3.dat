17After seeing the movie I wanted to read the book. I liked the story, sadly the Proper_Noun edition is another poor scan with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and has obviously not been corrected. Many missing spaces or wrong characters \'j\' instead of Proper_Noun etc...5 stars for the story, but only 2 for the scanning.
