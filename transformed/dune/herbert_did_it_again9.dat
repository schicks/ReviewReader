26The epic story of the Proper_Noun line is continued with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Although the origional Proper_Noun was far better, this book still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert creates a world so far advanced in the future that it boggles the mind. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun places a slightly larger emphasis on the vast abilities of the mind, especially with Proper_Noun ability to see through oracular vision after he was blinded by the stone burner. Herbert appears to become estranged from the action adventure themes of Proper_Noun and more involved with philosophy. This makes it harder to read, as opposed to the effortless flow of Proper_Noun However this book is nessecary for anyone who read Proper_Noun to satisfy their craving for the rest of the story. This is where most of Proper_Noun acclaims origionated. I beleive he saw this as an immediate reacction to the work, and decided to leave the reader in just as much suspense as before at the end of the book. This ending makes up for any of the flaws contained in this book when compared to Proper_Noun and I am now on the third book in the series, Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun It\'s looking about the same.
