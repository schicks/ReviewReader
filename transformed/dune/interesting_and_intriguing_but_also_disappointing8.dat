6I first read Proper_Noun several years ago, and remembered being intrigued, but also frustrated by it. I decided to re-read it (and the following 2 sequels), and my memories were confirmed. Proper_Noun is often described as the science fiction equivalent of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but Proper_Noun world-building isn\'t the equal of Proper_Noun Someone who reads the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun without reading Proper_Noun other Proper_Noun Proper_Noun stories would still find Proper_Noun world complete. Although the history of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is revealed in glimpses, it\'s clear that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun quest--fits within a well-realized world with a long history preceding the story in Proper_Noun created an intriguing universe and striking political dynamics. But I don\'t think the universe, and its history, was fully thought out. For example, he frequently references religions such as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but there are no convincing examples of how such religions work and how belief systems such as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun merged. Most of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun sayings quoted in the books are left without context; there\'s no real sense of how they fit together or how the philosophies differ. I think Proper_Noun imagination could best be described as broad, but not necessarily deep. His interest in philosophical and psychological theories seems to have trumped his interest in creating a thoroughly-realized universe.I appreciate the political dynamics that Proper_Noun explores, but, in the Proper_Noun universe, apparently no one ever has a straight-forward thought or discussion. Instead, everyone speaks in riddles, allusions, and metaphors, seemingly trying to be as obscure as possible. Certainly, when in a delicate political situation that linguistic approach makes sense, but its not realistic that family members and friends would communicate in this way.I also feel that Proper_Noun doesn\'t develop characters convincingly. Why do Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun love each other? What draws them together? There\'s no development of their relationship. In one scene, they meet, several things happen in rapid succession Proper_Noun takes the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and becomes a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun inherits Proper_Noun family, Proper_Noun is pre-born in the womb), and then there is a transition to a couple of years later, where Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are now parents. Why does Proper_Noun Proper_Noun trust Proper_Noun during the Proper_Noun attack when he suspected her to be a traitor shortly before? Why does Shaddam support the Proper_Noun over the Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun threat to the Proper_Noun dynasty is never made clear.Another frustration that I have is with Proper_Noun concept of prescience. I like the overall concept that prescience doesn\'t mean that someone like Proper_Noun can or will know everything in detail, and that there are blind spots. But does prescience set the future in stone? Proper_Noun frequently implies that, but then pulls back. So Proper_Noun sees the coming jihad but wants to avoid it; every time he does something, his internal monologue reflects whether the jihad is still inevitable (which, apparently, it is). But why is it inevitable? That\'s never made clear. If the future can be changed, then why is Proper_Noun trapped? And, if seeing the future essentially locks it in place, how does Proper_Noun have the power to lock that future in place for the rest of the universe? The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has the ability to see into the past, present, and future, but how does he have the ability to force a single path on the rest of the universe? This prescience problem becomes increasingly apparent in the sequels Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun realize that these criticisms make it seem that I dislike Proper_Noun I don\'t; I\'m frustrated because the universe and the story is so intriguing, with great potential, but the treatment feels superficial more often than not.
