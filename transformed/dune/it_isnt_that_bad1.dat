8The sequel to the brilliant Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun continues the story of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun leader of the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun This time, though, the story is less epic: The Harkonens have been defeated and a corrupt Proper_Noun has been cast away from his throne, the precious spice is now being distributed by necessary quantities and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun have gained Proper_Noun entire mistrust.This time we are told about a spiritually hurt Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a man who still cannot come to fully grasp the devastating power his god-like nature has on the psyche of those who worship him as a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun attempts to stop the bloody jihad set in motion by his messianic reign are futile and his minions seem to enjoy the bloody massacre just for the sake of killing, using Proper_Noun image solely as a shield, an excuse for mindless slaughter. Worst yet, his prescient powers have shown him the terrible future that awaits humanity, and the horrible alternative, a sacrifice so monstrous not even the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun dares face. Meanwhile, a conspiracy against Proper_Noun life is being cooked among a wide number of people, ranging from government agents to retired fedaykin warriors.Many judge this to be the worst among the Proper_Noun books, but personally I find it a very good read because we have a more direct chance to take a deeper look at Proper_Noun disturbed mind. A worthy little book filled with surprises.
