9Probably the most distinct moment of reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun came when my eyes lit upon the wonderful phrase: "Bijaz the catalyst dwarf." Only in the prose of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun could such a coupling be possible.As to Proper_Noun himself, Proper_Noun not really sure why he needed to be in the book. He didn\'t seem to be an essential character, just a peculiar garnish on the storyline. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun this ain\'t.I\'m a bit on the fence about this book. I see the point that some reviewers here are making, that it\'s the tragedy of Proper_Noun but I have a hard time finding his tragedy paramount or even compelling. As he, himself, says, 35 billion people have died in the holy war he unleashed. Next to that incredible cataclysm, his own sense of self-pity seems rather piddling, and his own relative inaction inexcusable.The action in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems more obscure than in its predecessor. I think a bit too much is left offstage. Developments seem to conjure themselves out of thin air. That said, it still leaves the overall storyline on an interesting path and doesn\'t disincline me from reading Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun
