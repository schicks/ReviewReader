11From 1979 to 1984 I read this Proper_Noun classic three times. Now sixteen years later Proper_Noun read it for the fourth time. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel was published in 1965 and is considered to be one Proper_Noun the greatest science fiction works Proper_Noun all time. Proper_Noun wrote a series Proper_Noun six Proper_Noun Proper_Noun before his death in 1986. This book, the first and greatest in the series, is a tale Proper_Noun political intrigue and revenge set on the desert planet Proper_Noun Proper_Noun commonly known as Proper_Noun The story encompasses religious and ecological themes as well as social upheaval. The wealth Proper_Noun the planet is the geriatric spice known as melange, and Proper_Noun is the sole source Proper_Noun the spice. The prescient powers Proper_Noun the spice allow for space travel. The hero Proper_Noun the story, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun son Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is caught up in a far-reaching tale Proper_Noun a feud between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and a centuries-old scheme Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun sisterhood to secretly breed a being with mental powers able to bridge space and time.In 1984 Proper_Noun Proper_Noun brought Proper_Noun to the big screen with a mixed degree Proper_Noun success. Naturally he had to do some serious trimming Proper_Noun the sprawling novel in order to encapsulate it in a movie. He also made some marked changes to the story. I read this novel again for three reasons: 1) Because it\'s a favorite Proper_Noun mine; 2) as a precursor to watching the Sci-Fi Proper_Noun six-hour Proper_Noun mini-series; and 3) Proper_Noun Proper_Noun son, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in collaboration with seasoned writer Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Anderson, has written a trilogy Proper_Noun prequels to the Proper_Noun saga and I want to have the story fresh in my mind when I read the first Proper_Noun them, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun have read five Proper_Noun the six Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series. The second, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun continues the story Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but is otherwise unremarkable. The third, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a tale with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as the protagonists. The fourth is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and was my least favorite, as it was heavy on philosophy and short on action. The fifth is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which I barely remember and it is set thousands Proper_Noun years after the events Proper_Noun the first three books. Some liken Proper_Noun to the style Proper_Noun the first book and I plan on reading it again. The sixth book in the series is called Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and purportedly picks up where Proper_Noun leaves off. I\'ll read it after I finish re-reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun note from the official Proper_Noun Proper_Noun site: "Shortly before his death, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had begun work on Proper_Noun 7, and he had discussed writing possible future Proper_Noun projects with Proper_Noun Because Proper_Noun the beautiful and moving dedication to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mother, in Proper_Noun for ten years Proper_Noun felt that the story should stop there, even though the last novel ends on a cliffhanger. In 1996, though, two safe deposit boxes were discovered that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had sealed before his death. Inside those boxes, Proper_Noun discovered the full and complete outline for Proper_Noun 7, the final Proper_Noun novel Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had intended to write, which wraps up all the story threads from the previous six books.Brian and Proper_Noun do intend to write Proper_Noun 7, but it will not be the next project in line. Due to the complexity Proper_Noun the outline, many things need to be established in earlier novels, and it also seems fitting that Proper_Noun 7 should be the last Proper_Noun novel published."
