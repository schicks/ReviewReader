131I have climbed out of bed to write this for you, because I can take it no longer. Whoever made the kindle version should be fired. The book itself is great. However, random missing spaces, extra spaces, italics that begin or end when they shouldn\'t, mis-spellings of stillsuit as Proper_Noun buy another version. This is an embarrassment to e-publishing....and you\'d think with it being on the computer it\'d be easier to check for errors. Guess not.Look elsewhere for your ebook copy of Proper_Noun
