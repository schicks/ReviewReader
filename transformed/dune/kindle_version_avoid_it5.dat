49This a review of the Proper_Noun version!!Today I decided to start reading this book on the train to work. I read mostly on the train or the bus to and from work. I took out my Proper_Noun touch and started to read. I read a couple of pages but it was so noisy on the train so I decided to listen to the audio book instead. It started and when the narrator came to the 2nd paragraph I realized that I hadn\'t read the text he was reading just a couple of minutes before. I took out my Proper_Noun again to check and I was right. Now at work I went to this page and looked at the preview of the book vs the Proper_Noun version and I saw that the 2nd paragraph of the book was missing from the Proper_Noun version. I am very surprised to see this. I also have the paperback at home Proper_Noun am in the process of going fully digital on my great Proper_Noun reader). For me, who is a perfectionist when it comes to books and most other stuff Proper_Noun want to read exactly what the writer and editors have written and published), this is completely unacceptable (what other stuff is missing from the Proper_Noun version I asked myself). I guess I have to take out my paperback to be able to read this book with the full text.So to conclude, Proper_Noun this Proper_Noun version if you want to read what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wrote.
