27I\'ll start by saying that I LOVE the book Proper_Noun and have for years. The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars. The only reason Proper_Noun only giving my review one star is because the Proper_Noun version is so full of typos and formatting errors. I can\'t believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Proper_Noun version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer. I can\'t imagine that this version was even proofread. It\'s distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful. DO Proper_Noun buy the Proper_Noun version. Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy.
