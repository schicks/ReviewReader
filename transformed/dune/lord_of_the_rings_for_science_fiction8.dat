8Finished my reread of Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It still holds up extrememly well--I believe it\'s The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun for science fiction.I won\'t recount the plot here, since there are probably a million reviews of the book and the series, and lots of folks have seen the regrettable Proper_Noun Proper_Noun movie (fortunately for millions of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fans, Proper_Noun turned down Proper_Noun to direct Proper_Noun The movie was like looking at something through pavement heat--you can tell what it is that you\'re supposed to be seeing if you can account for the distortion. But, Proper_Noun biased; I don\'t understand how Proper_Noun continues to get work.But I digress. There are at least two things about Proper_Noun that really make the novel stand out against the background of other science fiction novels:First, the absence of technology. As part of the backstory of Proper_Noun there was a revolt against computers in humanity\'s past (our future), and they are banned from society. This plot convention steers Proper_Noun away from where many science fiction works crash and burn--an obsession with technology and "technobabble." Some sci-fi is so tech-heavy that the stories read like stereo instructions. Sadly, this is a trend which has only gotten worse after the advent of cyberpunk. Rejecting technology as a crutch allowed Proper_Noun to focus on the humanity of his characters.Second, the story is character-intensive. The characters a very well developed, and Proper_Noun develops them with an economy that should make other writers envious. The exposition in Proper_Noun is kept to a minimum, which is remarkable considering the tone that Proper_Noun possesses. Almost alone in the genre, Proper_Noun has a voice that\'s more akin to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Arthurian legend. The story is an epic on a grand scale, with nuanced heroes and villains that lack Proper_Noun length Proper_Noun beauty) or Proper_Noun ponderous prose. The way the characters interact with situations, each other, and even within themselves shows Proper_Noun skill as a writer.One helpful note to Proper_Noun if you\'ve seen the movie, then you know the general idea of the plot. Go ahead and read the appendices at the back of the book first. It\'s not great reading, but it will give a little more backstory that\'ll make the book easier to understand.If you haven\'t seen the movie version of Proper_Noun just start the book from the beginning. The appendices have a few spoilers in them if you\'re new to the story.Dune explores a number of important topics with depth that\'s rarely acheived in science ficiton: religion, climate change, human nature, life, death, ecology, among many others. It\'s an outstanding read.
