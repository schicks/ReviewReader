61One of the problems with a sequel is that it must contend with the preconceptions of readers, who have ideas about where the plot should go. Never mind what the author thinks, thank you very much. In this case, the handicap is what we think Should Happen to Proper_Noun after all he\'s gone through in Proper_Noun Isn\'t this the time for them to ride off into the sunset? It would be really great to think that he is a wonderful guy, marries Proper_Noun and lives happily ever after. A lot of the reviews of this second volume in the encyclopedic Proper_Noun series seem to yearn for it. Sorry, we have to disappoint you.Imagine for a moment that you are the son of a pretty influential guy, that you are pretty happy in your present home, and dad\'s boss sends him on a wild goose chase after a fortune, hoping, no Proper_Noun that you fail, in order that he can secure a fortune, kill your whole family, and discredit your name forever. Now imagine that you narrowly escape, head off to exile where you are treated with suspicion, alternately an outsider and then as a god. In taking your revenge, you acquire the most important commodity in the universe, and you acquire the status of cult hero living god and emperor of the universe. Do you really think that you would be Proper_Noun Nice Proper_Noun after all that?If one looks at Proper_Noun in this light, what happens in this sequel, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems right. Your relcuctant bride, Proper_Noun is sure to be bitter, and want only to be the bearer of the next emperor. If you are Proper_Noun Proper_Noun you would do anything to interfere with Proper_Noun If you are from one of the conquered worlds, you very likely not be happy about this bitter Proper_Noun being emperor. If you are of the spacing guild you won\'t be happy about him having control of the spice. If you are a Proper_Noun disciple, you are going to die for him and the heck with anyone else. Thus the fight card is set: Proper_Noun and his cult vs. all his detractors, virtually everyone in the universe. Proper_Noun Herbert gives us the blow-by-blow in a relatively compact synopsis.Perhaps the above is a bit too obtuse. Suffice it to say that if you expect to find Proper_Noun Wonderful hero in this, you should look elsewhere. Likewise if you need a warm and fuzzy romance or a shootemup space opera, you may not want to venture here. But if you want to explore the logical consequences of the price of power, and the bitterness it generates, this is just the ticket. I have read and reread this series at different times of my life, and each time am amazed at what I find new in each reading. Proper_Noun Herbert holds up well beside so-called Proper_Noun authors, and is head and shoulders above most of our current fantasy crop. Read this book and the rest of the series with an open mind and be amazed.
