5Dune is perhaps the last great work of a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This is not to say that Proper_Noun as a genre is no longer worth reading, but nearly all authors of the genre now conceptualize of themselves as \'Science Proper_Noun authors\', and this was not always the case.Dune is not, first and foremost, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It is commentary. It is some of the most biting and intelligent commentary on religion and government (as well as a plethora of other subjects, ranging from trade unions to ecology) ever written.The fact that it is cloaked in a fantastical future should have no more bearing on our treatment of it than does, say, the fictions of 1984.Dune is one of the greatest stories ever written. This is my firm belief, having read more books than I can care to count. The characters are deep and passionate. Entirely unlike anyone most of us have ever known, yet immenently believable all the same. They are the sort of people we are assured must exist; the sort of people we know mankind is capable of producing.The villains are evil, the heroes are good. There is no ambiguity, but that is because the purpose of the book is not to shed light on the distinctions of good and evil within individual humans, but to investigate the power-plays among people on the grander level.One thing I would caution against when reading this book: commit yourself to reading it. Many find the first half of the book quite slow. Some would even say tedious. Push through it, I beg you. For if you do not, you are cheating yourself of a great joy.And when you finish Proper_Noun continue to the rest of the books in the series. Part of the reason the first half can seem to drag is because Proper_Noun was establishing a universe of incredible complexity. He was thinking in the long term, over a span of six or seven books.And he succeeded in building that universe. The universe of Proper_Noun Of Proper_Noun And it will live on in people\'s minds for many years to come.
