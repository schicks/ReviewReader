6I Proper_Noun this book and the movie. The only issue I have is that nobody seems to have proofread the copy before it was published for the Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun version constantly has words that are run together likethis. It\'s not too bad if it\'s just once in a while, but in some chapters it\'s several times per page. That is the only reason I didn\'t give this one a 5 star review. Otherwise, it\'s an excellent story.
