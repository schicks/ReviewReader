9This book has long been acclaimed as a sci-fi masterpiece, and it deserves it. Frank Proper_Noun has created a rich, full universe, centered on the desert planet Proper_Noun also known as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun itself is (at least on the surface) a barren, forbidding chunk of rock with extremely forbidding climate. It would be a worthless, unknown backwater except for one small fact: It is the only source of the spice Proper_Noun which is required for faster-than-light travel. Since an interstellar civilization cannot survive without faster-than-light travel, the value of Proper_Noun becomes obvious.The central character of the book is the young man Proper_Noun Proper_Noun heir to the dukedom of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which has been recently placed in charge of Proper_Noun by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun His father, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun smells a trap being laid for him by his enemies but takes the position anyway out of loyalty to his Proper_Noun Accompanying him is hs concubine Proper_Noun who is Proper_Noun mother and a member of the mysterious Proper_Noun Proper_Noun an ancient order of women with mysterious power. Plotting against the Atreides are their mortal enemies, the Proper_Noun led by the devious and clever Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his nephews, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun plot of the book is concerned to a great extent with the ecology of Proper_Noun We learn about the great Proper_Noun that roam Proper_Noun vast deserts, plus the mysterious native Proper_Noun who coexist with the worms. We also learn about the relationship between the worms and Proper_Noun as well as the Proper_Noun plan to transform Proper_Noun into a lush paradise. The Proper_Noun are given a complex society which borrows heavily from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun influences. The complex scheming and plotting between the Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun not to mention the Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun organization of space navigators with a monopoly on space travel), make for complex and interesting reading.The place where, I believe, Proper_Noun falls short is in its skimping over action scenes. There are a few points in the novel where action scenes are very well laid out, mostly small one-on-one duels and such, but there are a number of very large battles, both in the land and on the ground, that are skimmed over very rapidly. In fact, one of the most pivotal battles in the book is mentioned only by word of mouth. There is one major exception, though - the rescue of a crew of spice harvesters from the clutches of one of the giant Proper_Noun is an extremely dramatic, well-written moment.There\'s also just not a lot of emotion in the book. The main characters never seem to make any decisions or take any actions from passion or anger. Everything is done with a cold, icy, methodical calculation.Overall, this is excellent sci-fi, but a very cold book. Young readers will have a hard time with it. Also, if you\'re more interested in action and such, there\'s little to be found directly. The book is very slow-moving for the most part. But, if you like a lot of cloak-and-dagger intrigue and plotting, not to mention heavy doses of mysticism and prophecy, then this is the book for you.
