11I give Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun five stars not because I belong to any small group of overzealous supporters, but because it is honestly one of the finest science-fiction novels I have ever read.DUNE combines the best of "golden-age" science fiction. (space opera, emperors, genetic supermen) with the technological believability of the 60\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun . Although Proper_Noun writing is plodding and stilted, the reader is ultimately kept reading to learn more about the byzantine politics of the Proper_Noun and the wonderfully portrayed environment of the desert planet Proper_Noun reason the book deserves notice is because it is appealing to all ages, much like the works of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I read Proper_Noun for the first time as a 10-year old and again ten years later, seeing the plot from a different angle but no less impressed with Proper_Noun world building.Granted, a lot of people are going to be put off by the prose, but the plot machinations and futuristic-but-feudal society make the book fantastic. And the setting is extremely original. As the reviewer below pointed out, the planet is really the main character.
