48I read Proper_Noun over three years ago, and naturally I loved it. When I tried to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I couldn\'t, I found it boring, and felt that the main character was now too old. Recently, I reread Proper_Noun and continued on through to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun reading both in only two weeks. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is really just a continuation of the first, and it delivers a \'triumphant tragedy\' that is makes a fitting end to the life of a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is thirty now (not very old at all), and the Proper_Noun he feared so much is serving the purpose it is supposed to, mingling the genes of humanity and ending the stagnation that existing under the old Proper_Noun system. He has been made both an Proper_Noun and a Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun leads his religion. Pilgrims come in their thousands to Proper_Noun to experience his Proper_Noun However, there are many who plot against him. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wish to destroy Proper_Noun before he has the chance to establish an Proper_Noun dynasty and regain the precious genes they worked so hard to create. The Proper_Noun long for the old ways when water was precious and Proper_Noun was theirs. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun want to gain a kwisatz haderach they can control, and the priests of Proper_Noun own religion wish to make a martyr of him. And with his prescience, Proper_Noun sees disaster for all man kind unless he follows one set path of the future, but is he willing to pay the price that comes with that future? The plots that surround Proper_Noun are intriguing in their own right, but more intriguing is the development of Proper_Noun himself. Or rather, Proper_Noun realisation that what he has created leads to its own stagnation. His powers also develop somewhat, making him an even more realistic Proper_Noun and finally, it ends in what is in many ways a tragedy, I certainly left this book feeling sad, but it is also in many ways a triumph. I do not feel that this revelation spoils the book, because it could be sumised because of the Proper_Noun nature of Proper_Noun and because from the very begining of this book, all paths lead to a tragedy in one form or another. Once I got over the initial depression, I realised that this book perfected the Proper_Noun story begun in Proper_Noun and together they make one of the best works of literature ever. I feel that the two must be considered as one story.
