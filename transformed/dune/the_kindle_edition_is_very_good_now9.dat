2I have read Proper_Noun many times, so I am very familiar with the text. I am also annoyingly good at noticing typos and other errors. I just finished reading the Proper_Noun edition of Proper_Noun and I did not notice a single error. It appears that the quality issues that are raised by the currently most helpful review have been resolved. Next up, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun OK, it looks like the reviews for the Proper_Noun editions of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun are all combined, so I can\'t provide separate reviews. So here\'s what I found:In Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I noticed a total of five errors. They generally consisted of hyphens in the middle of words, or extra spaces in the middle of words.In Proper_Noun if Proper_Noun I noticed a similar number of hyphenation or word spacing errors. At the end of the book, there was a rash of improper line breaks or quotation endings -- perhaps four of them.I consider all three books to be perfectly readable in their current form. Personally, I do not regret buying the Proper_Noun editions.
