488I know some people who hate the movie and will not touch this book. I know a few who own and love the movie but have never read the book. I have lent Proper_Noun to friends who could get no further than page 20 because it was too "out there" or too difficult, with its array of characters and glossary of made-up terms. But of all the people who have gotten past page 20- I don\'t know one who doesn\'t praise it among their absolute favorites. I am no exception.I love sci-fi but don\'t read much of it because I prefer fantasy. Proper_Noun feels like a perfect blend of the two. A war of noble houses set in space.

His father, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is given charge of Proper_Noun a hellish desert-world and the sole source of Proper_Noun spice" which the entire universe needs. A very prestigious assignment, but treachery and peril comes with it. Paul finds himself thrown into the mystery of Proper_Noun and its fierce natives, the Proper_Noun Is he the savior their prophecy speaks of?I was first blown away by Proper_Noun at the age of 16, and have since considered it Proper_Noun one to beat". In 8 years, very few books have made me question Proper_Noun judgment: Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I had to reread it to be sure I wasn\'t just na\xefve at the time. Was it really Proper_Noun great? Absolutely.
