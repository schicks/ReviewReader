138The first time a read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was more than a little disappointed. By when I re-read Proper_Noun I also re-read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This was the first time Proper_Noun read them back-to-back, and I realized that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was actually the conclusion to Proper_Noun and not a seperate book. As a stand alone book it\'s barely passable, as a sequal it\'s worth 3-stars, but as the fourth part of the first book it\'s a perfect conclusion. Proper_Noun was divided into 3 parts (called books) and the last ends with a nice Proper_Noun ending. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun shows the real conclusion to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the real consequences of his actions in the rest of the book. I think Proper_Noun had to end the first book with Proper_Noun on top of the Proper_Noun because that is what reader\'s want, but Proper_Noun is a more somber look at what it means to have power. After I had re-read Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I came across used cliff notes for Proper_Noun and I noticed that it had an essay which treated to two books as one and compared them to a Greek epic pointing out that Greek epics didn\'t end when the hero was on top, but continued to the end of the hero\'s life. With the inclusion of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun now tells us the complete story of Proper_Noun life, and what an incredible story it is. Do not read this book, rather read Proper_Noun and this book together.
