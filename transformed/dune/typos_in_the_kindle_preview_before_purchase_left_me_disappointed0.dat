23After seeing typo complaints about the Proper_Noun edition, I decided to look at the free initial chapters before plunking down that much $$. It didn\'t take me long: Proper_Noun was bom on Proper_Noun in the 5th sentence of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Come on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun either significantly reduce the price or get it right Proper_Noun do the 40th Proper_Noun proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo Proper_Noun credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Proper_Noun saga Proper_Noun time on the Proper_Noun 3 when it becomes available). Now I think Proper_Noun just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!
