3This book has been reviewed more than 1,667 times on Proper_Noun 1998 of those are five star ratings. So you know it\'s a great book, but why it\'s great may escape you from the reviews I read. I bought the book having heard it\'s a classic, but knowing absolutely nothing about it, and the reviews I read didn\'t make me more inclined to read it. The author is obviously a genius, I mean a calculus and physics kind of genius, who figured out what the magnetic draw of a charismatic president could do to a country more than 60 years ago. He dropped hundreds of spectacular gems you probably never even considered before. Things that could change the way you think about life. In addition, the story moves along more rapidly than most, and moves from step to step in a deeply coherent manner that was being set up for chapters but escaped your notice until it unfolded. Sometimes I was startled by the rapidness. All 900 pages of it. The other end of the universe from Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun This is the story of a 15 year old who suffered defeat and hid in the desert until he became the ultimate ruler and foundation of a new religion. Great plot, great characterization, great pace. Very little about the military stuff, a great deal about the other stuff. Great everything. Perhaps my favorite book. A fabulous read that will stick with you long after you put the book down.
