7A great book, that I would love to re-read after all these years, but I can\'t bring myself to pay 2x as much for a Proper_Noun version of a book over a paperback. Penguin books seems to have an issue with digital, because all their Proper_Noun books are grossly overpriced. It\'s too bad, if they made it the same price as the paperback, they\'d sell a lot more copies. Join us in the Proper_Noun age Proper_Noun
