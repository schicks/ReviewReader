8Written by Proper_Noun Scott Proper_Noun in the 1920\'s, The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun never ceases to depict the fallibility of the typical wealthy Proper_Noun It is also a fine representation of the Proper_Noun dream and the price that comes along with it. The theme that I was imbued most by was the inability to grasp time: past and present. Proper_Noun is the typical wealthy Proper_Noun in the 1920\'s who lives the life wanted by all Proper_Noun His involvement in bootleg alcohol tends to make him a shady character; however, he is in a way the fallible hero. His undying love for Proper_Noun was what brought him to the life of organized crime and illegal activities. Along with the theme are symbols used to further substantiate the theme of wealth and time. For example, the clock that Proper_Noun tips over and catches shows how he is desperate to take control of time and bring what he wants: a chance with Proper_Noun His courage and motivation to win the woman of his dreams nevertheless proves that wealth cannot bring back what was past and over. Fitzgerald\'s use of symbols is what represents most the books\' themes. It also serves as a lesson that what is past is past and that there is only a chance at moving on, not staying in the past.
