5A dreadful version of the timeless classic, this ill-considered reading by Proper_Noun dulls the novel\'s sharp social criticism. Proper_Noun is best suited to comedy, to loveable boobs who stumble through life without a hint of tragedy or despair. These human conditions weigh heavily inside the black heart of Proper_Noun work, which is unsettling not only for its accurate portrayal of patrician soullessness but also for its message that the American Proper_Noun is a rotten carrot dangled before us. Proper_Noun is the wrong voice for the job. As other reviewers have noted, his female characters come off like opium addled Proper_Noun This Louisvillian can attest that our women, here represented by Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun do not talk like deep fried lotus eaters. How disappointing to get yet another unsatisfactory rendering of Proper_Noun arguably our best writer, if not the best chronicler of the class stratification that we Americans try so desperately to deny. The film with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun remains an umwatchable dud, but this reading is equally poor.
