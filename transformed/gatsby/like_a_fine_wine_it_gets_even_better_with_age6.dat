132I\'m troubled that many young people in these reviews don\'t seem to appreciate this novel. Even when "forced" to read it in high school, I loved it. I\'ve read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it\'s better than I remembered it. I was prompted by the character is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book Norwegian Proper_Noun who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up. This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that\'s not perfect. I have to agree -- it\'s not just the plot, it\'s the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later. Even after years, who can forget the scene when Proper_Noun shows Proper_Noun all his custom made shirts, or Proper_Noun describes his first vision of Proper_Noun by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Proper_Noun parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea. For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend. It\'s so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in Proper_Noun and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory. Don\'t miss out on this one. If you didn\'t like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature.
