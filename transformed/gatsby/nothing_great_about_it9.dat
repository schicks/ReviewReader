35I like to think of myself as an open-minded person, willing to embrace any good story that comes into my life, as long as there is some meaning behind it. Hell, there doesn\'t even have to be a profoundly deep meaning hidden within a novel for me to like it, just as long as there is some redeeming value to it all. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has neither enjoyment nor meaning, despite what all the critics and analysts may think. Of course, that is only my opinion and I can\'t tell others what to think.When I began reading The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun my opinion of it was entirely neutral, (as it goes with every novel I read). I knew that it was considered a masterpiece. I saw that it was number two on the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 100 greatest novels. Yet, I didn\'t roll into my reading with extremely high expectations; I just let the book speak for itself, as the pages unfolded in front of my eyes.The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is told from the point of view of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a middle class man who moves back Proper_Noun into a wealthy neighborhood. The book opens with him at his cousin\'s house. A small get together is in progress, and we are introduced to some of the main characters. We meet Proper_Noun an athletic, hot tempered, adulterous man. We meet Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wife, a cheerful and rather innocent girl. Finally, we meet Jordan. Jordan is Proper_Noun good friend, a rather gossipy and dishonest woman. They drone on about nothing in particular and the first scene ends.In the scenes that follow we encounter Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who is supposedly the hero of the story. He is the American Proper_Noun He is the typical "rags to riches" story some of us might envy. He is a very mysterious man, and rumors fly in every which way about him. Rumors such as how he inquired his money and where he came from. He throws large parties and invites Proper_Noun to them, along with countless other shallow people whom Proper_Noun has no interest in.The reason Proper_Noun engages in all these parties and hoopla, is an attempt to win back the love of his past, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wife). He has acquired all this money and attempts to take her from her husband Proper_Noun Proper_Noun meanwhile, has a mistress across town that he uses for sex and is quite abusive towards.Well, all the parties and conversations eventually lead up to the climax at the end of the novel. I won\'t reveal too much except for the fact that a lot of sparks fly between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mistress (Mrs. Wilson) and the mistress\'s husband, Proper_Noun Wilson. If I were to say anything else it might ruin it for you. Although by that time, if you are like me, you won\'t really care. The narrator, Proper_Noun meanwhile just fades into the background and tells us the story in an offhanded kind of manner.The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fails on so many levels. I don\'t know where to start. The novel is supposed to be highly symbolic. I have nothing against symbolic novels, I usually adore them, but in this case it was different. I read the Proper_Noun Notes and it still did not change my opinion. What good are symbols when their meaning doesn\'t really add to the depth or meaning of the story?Another major failure is the dismal writing style. I couldn\'t stand it. To me, it seemed Proper_Noun just wanted to show off his vocabulary. I don\'t have a problem with that, but he mixes words together in a rather strange and incoherent fashion, which does not make a whole lot of sense or add any power whatsoever to the story. Another failure: The characters are extremely one dimensional. I didn\'t feel like I really knew any of them by the time the novel was complete, and I certainly did not care about them.That brings me to my final failure of the novel that I will mention: the ending. I have said this in other reviews I have written. How am I or why should I care when tragic events occur to characters that I don\'t even care about? It is impossible. I really didn\'t care about anyone in this book, because the author did not shape and mold them into the vivid, memorable characters we read about in so many other masterpieces. Endings like this always worsen the overall credibility of a novel when adequate preparation has not been put in place, as if the author is trying to manipulate us into thinking how grand of an ending it was. Tragedies are great, if they have been properly framed and constructed from the beginning of the novel.The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has been said to mean things varying from "Social Proper_Noun to "Religion", to the seven deadly sins, and so on. Rest assured that I don\'t rely on others to tell me whether or not a novel is great. I did not hate this book, but as a "classic", it fails miserably, and it was not enjoyable to read. In my eyes, it is a shame that a book so mediocre can place number two on any list, let alone be considered one of the greatest books of all times. If I had to some up The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in one word, it would be "empty." If I could have one more word it would be "hollow." You be the judge. The only thing more mysterious than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his infamous title, is the fact that this tale could be considered Proper_Noun by anyone.Grade: C-
