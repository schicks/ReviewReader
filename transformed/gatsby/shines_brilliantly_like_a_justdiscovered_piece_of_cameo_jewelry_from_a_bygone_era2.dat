253It\'s difficult to give any even-handed critique Proper_Noun Scott Proper_Noun standard-setting Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you\'ll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920\'s is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun modest Proper_Noun Proper_Noun neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Proper_Noun is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance.

The strength of Proper_Noun treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author\'s economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era. It is well worth re-reading, especially at such a bargain price.
