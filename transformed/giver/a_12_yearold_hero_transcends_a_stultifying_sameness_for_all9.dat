12This book will become a classic among the many wonderful novels about the potential for counter-utopias (creating the opposite of a better life for humanity), and deserves far more than five stars. I found it as interesting and rewarding as 1984, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Proper_Noun was one of her picks. She said, "It\'s an awesome book, Proper_Noun and it will only take you an hour to reread." My wife then chimed in and said I really should review this book for Proper_Noun So here it is.Ms. Lowry paints a bleak picture of having achieved equal lives for all. Everyone gets the same things, and interactions are modulated so that there will be a minimum of social disorder. Think of this as socialism turned into a low-security prison camp operated by the inmates with the help of drugs to keep everyone\'s minds and emotions numb.The book evolves through the life of Proper_Noun a 12 year old, who has lived this life of great civility and little intensity up until the book\'s beginning. Then he goes through a great ritual in which each young person begins specific training for their life\'s work, as determined by the collective to best fit their skills and personalities.Jonas is to have a role that he did not even know existed. He is to be the one person in the society who will have memories of what occurred before the collective state was formed. His tutor will be the man who has had this role until now. That man is the Proper_Noun I won\'t tell you any more, because I don\'t want to spoil the story. The rest proceeds much like what would occur with a hero in an Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel. The resolution of the conflict is a particularly inventive and thought-provoking one.This book is particularly good for showing the dangers of having everyone think alike. I heartily endorse its message of exploring Proper_Noun thoughts and experiences. Those provide us with greater comfort than a grey conformity that we do not even perceive as such.After you have finished enjoying this outstanding book, I suggest that you ask yourself what rules your family has that could be creating missed opportunities to be more caring and close to one another. After you locate those rules, I suggest you have a discussion about the benefits of changing those rules. Good luck!May you find warmth and love wherever you go!!
