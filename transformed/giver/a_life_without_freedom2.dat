10By Proper_Noun was a happy, twelve-year-old boy, who lived his day to day life with a rigid routine: going to school, playing with friends, doing volunteer hours and spending time with family in his dwelling. He lived a peaceful, perfect life of Proper_Noun He and his fellow members of society each went through the many ceremonies, each providing new opportunities. All of these later led to the very last one: The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun the much anticipated celebration into adulthood. This is where they get their life\'s assignment. When the time came for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun he was in for the shock of his life. In just one day, Proper_Noun was given an honorable position in his society. No one would look at him the same way again. During his training, Proper_Noun learned the truth about his society and its past. Slowly, Proper_Noun life changed and so did his thoughts until they transformed into something more. He was determined to know what lay Proper_Noun outside of his utopian society. His thoughts transformed into an action, and off he went into the darkness.The Giver is written so differently from any other book that I have read. It is the type of book that many adolescents may not be able to fully understand, since it is describing a society so different from ours. From the way Proper_Noun described Proper_Noun society, it would be classified as a utopian society. There are no troubles, except for very superficial emotions that the people feel, minimal choices, and rigid rules. The society is dull, civilized, and focused on perfection. Proper_Noun seems to have developed her own vocabulary especially for The Proper_Noun She uses words like, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and stirrings, which can only be fully understood after carefully reading the context in which it is used. I also notice that she is fond of using cliffhangers. At the end of each chapter, the very last sentence is either shocking or a riveting description. Regardless, it was a page-turner.The Giver turned out to be one of my favorite books. It was interesting for me to picture our society being similar to Proper_Noun I thought that maybe it would be a good thing because there would be no wars, no poverty, and no worries. As I got to the end of the book, I began to think that maybe it is not such a good idea after all-a life without freedom. What makes life worth living is the different problems we face and how we use our ingenuity to solve them and I think that Proper_Noun was successful in opening my eyes towards this fact. I feel that this is an important message for children aged twelve and above.
