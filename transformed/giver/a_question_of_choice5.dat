5In the wonderfully imaginative mind of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a futuristic Proper_Noun has been created where there is no more war, no more suffering, no more starvation, no more unemployment, no more choices. Everyone is seemingly happy. This is where a Proper_Noun named Proper_Noun lives.

But once under the instruction of his mentor, The Proper_Noun who teaches him the truth about the choices his ancestors made, Proper_Noun begins to understand the pain involved in bearing the burden of truth. Together with the Proper_Noun he makes the tough decision to initiate change, if he can survive long enough to do so.This book was one of the most engaging books I have ever read. Lowry has a talent for creating memorable characters and uses stark details that place the reader right alongside Proper_Noun She also has a knack for lucid pacing and dialogue. This book examines the question of the choices we might make to "make this world a better place," and the sacrifice that comes with comfort. I recommend this novel to readers of all ages.
