50One of the few books that I can ever read past the first few chapters, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has easily made its way into one of my favorite books. It\'s amazing how many only 170 some odd pages can work on so many levels- emotionally, socially, politically- and still pull it off. Lowry perfectly brings a coming-of-age boy Proper_Noun forced to live in a seemingly "perfect" community into receiving the truth about the past, a past where pain existed, a past where feelings existed. Jonas\' own naivete towards the world is the most interesting part of the book; watching him come to his own revelations about the very society he lives in, and the pure simplicity of his convictions: "But we SHOULD have choices!" Lowry leaves a lot of the book open for you to fill in the structure- she never really explains the whole concept of why people moved to "Sameness," and I really think that\'s for the best. I think it gives the message that maybe we really aren\'t made for perfection- because, perhaps, beauty comes in imperfection. A classic.
