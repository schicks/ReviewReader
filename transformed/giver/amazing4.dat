5The Proper_Noun was amazing! It was about Proper_Noun boy named Proper_Noun who lives in Proper_Noun community of Proper_Noun Where everything is the same and safe. Nobody has to worry about emotional pain. Everything was perfect until the Proper_Noun of 12. That\'s when everybody in his age group was assigned an assignment. When the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun skipped Proper_Noun the crowd became uneasy. They paid attention to the rest of the assignments but were still anxious about Proper_Noun After the last assignment the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun announced Proper_Noun selection. Proper_Noun was selected to be the reciever, the most honored job in the community. Proper_Noun starts his training and experiences pain, joy, and even more in depth feelings. Things he\'s never felt before.I finished this book in 2 days. That means it was Proper_Noun very good book. (And it earned me an Proper_Noun in reading) Recently our Reading teacher read aloud Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which, like The Proper_Noun was set in the future. This book was much easier to tell though because of the memories, having technology, and because of the animals. Also they were alike because Proper_Noun Proper_Noun left you hanging at the end. She wanted you to have imagination and figure out the ending on the own. And I still wonder if the boy with light eyes in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun or not.Overall this book was excellent!
