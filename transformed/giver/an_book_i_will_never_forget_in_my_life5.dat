24At first when i had to read The Proper_Noun for my english class, I was "This will be boring!". When I came back from school, I started reading...and i couldn\'t stop! This is a unique story, the people are all the same. They live in a world with no music, or color or differences or true love. They take a pill to make them act like robots. The community gives them a job and a spouse and a family. They get their jobs at the 12th year. There is peace, but they don\'t have almost any feelings! Jonas is choosed to be the Proper_Noun He will have all the memories of The Proper_Noun He will have all the memories of the old times (colors, love, pain, loneliness, hapiness...), so he can be the wiseman of the community, he will make the best decisions for the peace of the community. But only one person cannot handle all these feelings and he feels apart from the others, he feels he can\'t fit in anymore, like when he was still a child. He grows too old for a kid of his age and the other kids don\'t understand him. Then he learns the end of every person released in to the "Community\'s Proper_Noun But he decides to control his own future. With the help of the Proper_Noun he discovers that there is a different "elsewhere" for everyone, some place beyond the community, where the past, the present and the future are. This is a wonderful book, that made me smile and cry. I will never forget this book, who has strong feelings to communicate to the reader. I stopped reading sometimes, for a minute, and look around me, enjoy the colors, the music and the happiness of be free of my own feelings. This book is one of the best books I have ever read, i really love this book and I think everyone should read it.
