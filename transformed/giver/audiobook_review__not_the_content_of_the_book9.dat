39I purchased the Proper_Noun version of The Proper_Noun last year so one of my students whose comprehension is excellent but decoding skills are still emergent could read the book. He enjoyed listening to it, so I decided to use it with my seventh grade class. The man who reads the story has a pretentious way of talking that the students objected to. That would have been tolerable, but there were two other glaring problems with the Proper_Noun version of the book:1. There is music that plays randomly throughout the story. This was distracting and detracted from the story. I understand using music to signal the end of a CD Proper_Noun am listening to an audiobook that does just that), but this music was in the middle of chapters. It played behind a few very important scenes, scenes that were somber and serious. Uplifting, new age music with somber and serious scenes? Not for me. More problematic was how distracting it was for the students, who were asking why there was music playing rather than listening to the story.2. The narrator seemed to think Proper_Noun was a whiny, petulant, snivelly boy. In my multiple readings of the book, I found Proper_Noun thoughtful, patient, clever, and calm. He was not a whiner; he was not a complainer; he was not petulant. At the end of the book, The Proper_Noun reveals a secret to Proper_Noun that upsets him greatly. I had to turn off the Proper_Noun version because the way in which the narrator read Proper_Noun part was absolutely ridiculous and not how the book even says. Proper_Noun is supposed to be sarcastic...the narrator made him whine. Proper_Noun is supposed to be passionately caring...the narrator made him whine.Again, this review is for the Proper_Noun version only. The book itself is awesome. I love it. I am angry about the movie they\'re making because it\'s not going to represent the book. I am similarly angry about this audiobook because it doesn\'t represent Proper_Noun in a way I feel he -- and we, the readers -- deserve.
