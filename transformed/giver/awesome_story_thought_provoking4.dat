9The Proper_Noun was a good book. The story captivated me, but something was missing in it. I was always hoping for something more to happen. The book in my opinion was way to short Proper_Noun pages). The ending was just horrible. I wanted so bad for the next book to be the continuing story, but it does not. For such a great story I am disappointed that I will not learn was happens to Jonas, the Proper_Noun or the community...I am not one for drawing my own conclusions...
