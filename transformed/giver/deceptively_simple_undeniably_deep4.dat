6Referred to me by my wife, an elementary teacher, I was not especially excited at first to read this book. But, being an avid reader and believing that every book deserves a chance, I picked up The Proper_Noun and very soon found that I couldn\'t put it down. The Proper_Noun is the story of Proper_Noun a boy who lives in a futuristic 1984-esq society, where everything appears to be perfect. Selected to become the next "Receiver of Proper_Noun the most important role in the community, Proper_Noun is sent for training to a man who gives his name only as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a little slow to start, the story quickly picks up as Proper_Noun begins to see the world in a way he never imagined before, and the reader quickly begins to see a world that we may not be to far from, a world that we may want to avoid creating at all costs.As a future teacher myself, I feel confident in saying that the book itself is fairly easy reading, and could probably be read as early as 4th or 5th grade. The content, however, may be more appropriate for middle school or even high school. While the story does work on several levels, and could be understood by younger kids, there is a scene in the book that may be disturbing for them. But that is, in the end, the overall purpose of the book: to disturb us, to make us think and consider the nature of humanity and the cost of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a truly amazing book, one written with eerie clarity and foresight, one that could change your way of thinking in many, many ways.
