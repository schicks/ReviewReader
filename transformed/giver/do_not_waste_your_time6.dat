3If Proper_Noun like books that have no clear Proper_Noun then this book is for you. If Proper_Noun like books where the author (that would be the person who is suppoed to be WRITING the book - which would entail Proper_Noun the book) feels its ok to let Proper_Noun decide what happened to the characters at the end of her book, then this book is for you. I am one of those people who believe that a book should have a begining and middle and an ending (CONCLUSION). Call me crazy! The book has such a great premise, only to be Proper_Noun ruined by the ending (or non-ending). Do not waste your time - there are so many other really good books out there to read. Just not by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun
