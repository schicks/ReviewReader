7This genre is totally up my alley and Proper_Noun been meaning to read it for ages. The good news is you can finish it in a couple of hours. The bad news is it\'s not worth the time. I get it\'s a children\'s book, but that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be nuanced and well written. The plot is bare - just plain weird, in a rushed way, at the end - and so much of this very literal book turns into metaphysical mush in the closing pages. Big letdown. All the hype made me assume there was something really brilliant going on here. Not so much. Go read some Proper_Noun instead. Animal Proper_Noun perhaps.
