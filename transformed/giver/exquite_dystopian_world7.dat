1Dystopian themes are one of my favorite genres in literary fiction. The idea of an idyllic world which on its surface seem like utopia but is in reality dystopian. Eventually one person or a group of individuals, senses something is wrong in their world and starts to question society and start on an existential journey to discover deeper and or different meaning of living.The Proper_Noun is a gem of a novel is dystopia at its very best. This world of "sameness" that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has created is frightening in its understated menace. Twelve year old protagonist Proper_Noun is one of the most poignantly written character that I have ever read in literary fiction. I felt myself transported into his world and walked with on his trails to become his community\'s Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun As Proper_Noun gains more memories from the elder teacher, the Proper_Noun he quickly realizes that his is based upon lies and treachery. The Proper_Noun is a wonderful classic novel that address my themes of what it means to be family, community, and to be a self-actualized human. Highly recommended.
