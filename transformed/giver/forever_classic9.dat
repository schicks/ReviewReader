17I read and loved this book in middle school when it was part of the required reading. I wish that I had loved it as much this second time around. I decided to reread this book because the fourth book in The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun came out this past october, and I wanted to be able to have read all of the books and kept them in memory.I have to thank my seventh grade Proper_Noun teacher for giving me the love of this book as well as teaching it so well that I still remembered a lot of it even though I read it almost ten years ago. I could remember that one of the memories that Proper_Noun receives was the red sled, and how he passed memories onto Proper_Noun and how bummed he was that he did that even though he continues to do it.I loved Proper_Noun felt this sense of wrongness as he learned more about life past the Proper_Noun I think that it would have been a little better had Proper_Noun better described that there was this sameness earlier in the book rather then when we meet The Proper_Noun and he is introduced to the colors and other part of life he didn\'t know he was missing.I\'m looking forward to starting the rest of the series, although it is my understand that the books don\'t continue with Proper_Noun and his quest to escape the Proper_Noun
