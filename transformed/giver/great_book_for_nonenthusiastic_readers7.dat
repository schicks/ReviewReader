1Bought this for my 12 year old son. He started middle school this year and the reading requirements are high for his gifted program. He doesn\'t enjoy reading like he did when he was little. This is the 3rd book he\'s read this school year so far and.....he doesn\'t want to put it down! He normally enjoys graphic novels (you know, books with pictures for older kids) but he is hooked on this book! Worried about what he should read next.....
