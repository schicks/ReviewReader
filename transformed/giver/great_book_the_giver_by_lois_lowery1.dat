9...Jonas\'s is a twelve-year-old boy living in a perfect futuristic world. There is no fighting, no pain, and no color, everything is completely organized. Everyone is assigned a role in the community at age twelve. Proper_Noun is assigned to receive training from the giver. The Proper_Noun alone holds all of the memories of the real pain and happiness of life before the governors started the community. But when training begins, things start to get tough. By putting his hands on Proper_Noun back, the Proper_Noun can transmit memories. The memories can make Proper_Noun actually feel the pain or live the happiness. Proper_Noun finds out that his father has been lying to him about a baby boy, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is forced to take action. Even in a perfect world like Proper_Noun is in, life can be full of nasty surprises!!! I loved this book. Lois Proper_Noun did a great job of describing all the memories, it was like I was there instead of Proper_Noun I also liked this book because it was a page-turner. You would be surprised how often I said to my Proper_Noun Proper_Noun one more chapter, pleease?" At the end of the chapter she always left you hanging, which I personally think is a very good technique.I\'d recommend this book to more experienced readers who like science fiction books. The only reason I was a bit disappointed with it was the very last part. It was one of those endings that the author left you to decide the ending, and I don\'t really like those types of endings. But all in all The Proper_Noun was a splendid, fun book.
