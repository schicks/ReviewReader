41.5 STARSI know a lot of people read The Proper_Noun as part of school Proper_Noun but since I didn\u2019t I knew that I was going to before I saw the film. From what I heard it was a classic, and one of the first dystopian books that started the whole craze, yet I found it boring.That\u2019s what I would have expected from a book you\u2019re forced to read as part of Proper_Noun because teachers hate us like that, but it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting after the major hype from people with similar tastes to my own.I found the whole thing rather bland I found the whole thing rather bland (and not because that\u2019s the point of the world Proper_Noun created) but because there was no action, or romance to get behind; or even characters that stood out and made you root for them. It wasn\u2019t a very enjoyable read in general; sure it was quick, but that was because it had such a small page count and not because I was so interested that I flew through.It was basically a screwed up utopia, which now that I think about it is the premise of most dystopias. However it seemed to me that it could be easily fixed if The Proper_Noun simply backed off and stayed huddled away in his little corner, until Proper_Noun would replace him and do the same. It may seem a little shallow of me; I know this is where people comment on the book\u2019s depth and everything, but it seems like the easiest answer. (Also I don\u2019t think I care enough about the people in the society to want change to happen).This is just one aspect where the movie looks to be very different from the book; after all it\u2019s what Proper_Noun does best, right? Even from the trailer I can see that there will be more action and maybe even a little romance between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun that was non-existent in the novel. So I will see it, but I won\u2019t be continuing the series, especially since I have the option which some poor students didn\u2019t.Posted on: http://enchantedbyya.blogspot.co.uk/
