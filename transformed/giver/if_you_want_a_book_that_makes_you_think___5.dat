5This book is often overlooked by adults because of its Proper_Noun adult" label, which is too bad. I have never met anyone--adult or child--who has not been moved by this book.Lois Lowry is a master of storytelling, and this book is no exception. This is such a departure from her normal style of writing, and it is an absolutely amazing book. The idea of this "perfect" utopia and the restrictions placed upon its members are fodder for unbelievable conversation.I teach this novel to middle school students, and it never fails to amaze me how they respond to this novel. I recommend that this book be read and discussed by people of Proper_Noun ages. What a wonderful book for families to read together!(Be sure to check out Proper_Noun newest book, Gathering Proper_Noun the long-awaited companion to The Proper_Noun
