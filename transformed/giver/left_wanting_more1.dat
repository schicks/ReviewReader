1When I first read the summary for this novel, I thought it would be similar to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 1984 or a piece of modern, post-apocalyptic science-fiction. The story had similar characteristics such as: a "Big-Brother" type government and a society jaded by post-traumatic-stress, but surprisingly the novel set itself apart from other books of this nature. I was pleasantly surprised with the suspense throughout the novel. As soon as I thought I could predict their next move, the characters took me by surprise. Proper_Noun comes across as a happy, satisfied child who wants-for-nothing. Living with his father, mother and sister, Proper_Noun they seem like a very normal family. As the story progresses you learn of his communities need for Proper_Noun and callousness. When he is presented with his job as "Receiver," he is honored that the elders chose him for such a highly-respected position. Although he doesn\'t know much about his assignment, Proper_Noun is excited and eager to start his job. As the Proper_Noun starts to train him, the reader is on an emotional rollercoaster ride as they find Jonas\' position being less of an honor and more of a burden. Every truth he encounters leads him to a lie about his seemingly perfect community. Every emotional forbiddance becomes more of a temptation. The safety of sameness becomes a danger! Besides the beginning of the book being a little slow, I would definitely suggest this as a must-read! I was in high school when this book was published. It is unfortunate that this wasn\'t on our required summer reading list!
