5You know a book is worth reading when it sticks with you for nearly 20 years. I read this when it first came out...I was 10 years old. Through the years this story stuck with me, always in my mind and evoking a somewhat melancholy feeling. For years I searched for it, but could never remember its name or specific enough details to find it.After reading \'Brave Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at a friend\'s suggestion, the similarities inspired me to search again and here it is! This story profoundly affected me as a child and comes back to me often in my international work.I highly recommend this book to adults and mature children alike.
