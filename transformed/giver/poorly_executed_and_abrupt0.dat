7Felt like the first half of a longer book. I might have liked it if it weren\'t for the childish writing style. It reminded me of a the way a 10-year-old tells you about his day-- Proper_Noun this happened. And then this happened. And then this. And then this."Just not really good overall. As some of the other reviewers suggest, read 1984 or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or countless others instead. One might argue that this book has more of a metaphysical leaning but those concepts weren\'t really given the proper treatment. The lofty ending might not have been as bad if the first 90 percent of the book weren\'t so matter-of-fact.
