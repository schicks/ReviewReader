21This is a book I really *wanted* to like. It\'s generally well-written, it\'s a widely-banned book, and deals with really incredible themes (is a society flawed if people are happy in it, the relationship of memory and emotion, &amp;c.). In fact, the beginning and middle of the book are incredible--as is the very ending--Lowry brilliantly shows us a utopia/dystopia (the readers have to decide which they think it really is) and its effects. However, getting from the brilliant middle to the brilliant last page is a chore--after setting up a psychologically compelling picture of two people\'s struggles with the world they live in, the book turns into what I can only describe as a low-key adventure novel. It\'s almost as if Proper_Noun decided that continuing to write with the attention given the first three-quarters of the book would make it too long for the format, so a few shortcuts (having certain characters act in decidedly odd ways, essentially eliminating all dialogue) had to be taken--and it\'s a real pity, because the book had the potential to be a 4- or 5-star novel.
