117Perhaps because it\'s so lauded I expected more. It\'s just a 1984, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 451, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for kids -- I guess. It just made me want to read those books instead.There were many unanswered questions at the end of the book. I would have liked to have known why the community was the way it was and how it got there. How did people only see in black and white? How did they get rid of the sun? How did they grow crops if there was no sun? Why are the birth mothers considered so stupid and low, yet they\'re giving birth to the entire community -- therefore giving birth to stupid kids? How come Proper_Noun isn\'t stupid?Where is he at the end? It wasn\'t clear. Or Proper_Noun just too dumb to read into things. I would have liked more of a "fleshing out" of the community instead of the bare bones we are given. I\'ll buy anything -- just sell it to me.
