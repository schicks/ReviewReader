7Read it as a big kid - loved it.Read it as a not-exactly kid - loved it.Arguments that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is not a suitable book for kids come from adults. Proper_Noun put it simply. When my fifth grade teacher told the class we were going to be reading this book, I was happy. I\'d already read the book. Every week, once a week on Proper_Noun the entire class gathered round and we listened to our teacher reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun out loud. We analyzed it in class, and every single one of us (including those who hated books and reading) loved it.Some people say that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is inappropriate for children because it deals with death and other difficult social issues. This is the reason adults don\'t like it? If that\'s the case, they need a reality check. We\'d already studied about the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in school (mentioned in the book). We knew what the word Proper_Noun means. We understood the concept of "death". Maybe we Proper_Noun fully understand population control, but we knew it existed. Unnecessary sheltering is silly. This book drew us in with the first sentence. It opened our minds to things we knew Proper_Noun but Proper_Noun fully understand. It brought to light things that nobody ever wanted to mention because they were concerned we were too young. This is exactly what made the book wonderful.It\'s not just the world image that\'s interesting. I fell in love with Proper_Noun the moment the book started. He\'s an easy character to relate to, no matter what sort of a person you are. I connected to his need for accuracy. Others connected to his friendships and personality. All of the characters felt real at the beginning, but only halfway through do we realize how fake everything is. It was wonderful to reread the book and note all of the little things that had been hinted at, that only later became clear and necessary.This book is not just about a future void of differences. It\'s about relations between people, it\'s about being different, and it\'s about a boy who\'s trying to do his job, stay normal, but is realizing that he can\'t. The Proper_Noun himself is also a fascinating character that we very quickly learn to love like a grandfather. We see him at his best, and at his worst. We see humanity in an ignorant way.And yes, it\'s a children\'s book. Adults may find that the writing style is too simple for them. It\'s perfect for pre-teens. It\'s got enough of a plot to keep them interested, and isn\'t too difficult to read. It\'s a wonderful book that I don\'t think Proper_Noun ever stop loving.I recommend this book whole-heartedly. It\'s honestly one of the best books Proper_Noun ever read.
