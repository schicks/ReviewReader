5I got this book and decided to read it before I let my son read it, as recommended by the other reviewers on here. I\'m glad I did. It is a book that would be worth reading, but is Proper_Noun appropriate for a child of any age. Perhaps a teenager, but definitely Proper_Noun a young child. Also, what the other reviewers say is true about the ending of this book. The book is fairly well written until the end. It\'s like the author ran out of time, or else ran out of story idea, and just abruptly ends the book! The boy escapes with a baby, trying to save it\'s life, but then the story literally just ends! They are going down a sled, and the book just stops. What happens to them? Do they die? Do they live?? Do they find other people in a town or just freeze to death?? There is no warning that the story is about to end, except that you see that you are running out of pages. I would have actually rated the book with four stars, for the rest of it, had it Proper_Noun been for the completely abrupt and poor ending. I would Proper_Noun recommend it for children, as there are several inappropriate things for a child under the age of about 14 or so, but the actual book itself is decent until the end. The reason I feel that it is Proper_Noun appropriate for a younger child/preteen are as follows:It covers such things as sexual arousal in the young boy, as he starts having wet dreamsIt discusses killing babies, old people, and anyone who disobeys the rules more than twice. For example, the author goes into graphic detail about how the baby is killed, by describing the scene where the father is injecting the baby with a lethal dose of something through the fontanelle Proper_Noun spot) on the baby\'s head. Jonas discovers that all of the people who are "released" are actually killed by lethal injection.It covers descriptions of such things as war injuries, broken bones jutting out of skin, etc.For those able to handle this type of subject matter, it would be fine, but just be prepared for a very abrupt ending with many loose ends that never get tied up...you are left hanging to wonder what happens (and Proper_Noun in a good way) because after building the story, it literally just stops with no explanation. I\'ve never read a book that did this quite this badly. Had I realized it was going to end this way, I would Proper_Noun have actually read the book at all. However, until the end, it\'s a pretty well written book with an interesting storyline. It makes you see what life would be like without choices, pain, colour, memories, proper family, etc. It also shows the burden that would come in knowing what real life is like without being able to share it with anyone else.
