54This book immediately captivates you and puts you inside of a world unlike what we know. It was a real page turner at first. But, there were some things that I feel should have been better explained to make the story feel more real. For example, that author didn\'t explain Proper_Noun the people were unable to see color or Proper_Noun all hills were removed. About 3/4 of the way done, I realized that the end of the book was rapidly approaching and wondered Proper_Noun it would end. Well, it seems the author got a little bored and just decided to end it. The ending was terrible. TERRIBLE. This book had so much potential and the storyline itself was interesting. I really wish the author would have made the book longer and added an ending that would have made sense.
