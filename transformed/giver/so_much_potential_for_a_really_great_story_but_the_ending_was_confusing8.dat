4So much potential for a really great story, but the ending was confusing, disappointing. and went no where. I am left feeling that somehow the whole book didn\'t make it to my kindle. I "get" the message of the book but there are so many more worthier reads. Enders Proper_Noun is a good one; it had a beginning, middle and ending. How about 1984 or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In the end this books just didn\'t have enough depth or mental challenge for me. Granted Proper_Noun in my 70\'s and not 12 so maybe that\'s the problem.
