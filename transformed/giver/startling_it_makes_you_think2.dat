31This book I read first in 5th grade, and I loved it. Then I read it again in 7th grade, understood more, and then finally the last time I read it was in 8th grade, 3 years ago, but I loved it. I try to read it about every three years because it is the kind of book that you\'ll love hte first time you read it, but the more you read it, the more you understand. This book is touching, and it makes one think about our own society and where our future might be. If taken seriously, this book is a work of art, written so both children and adults can enjoy it. Definitely I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a different point of view on where technology and the media might be leading us!
