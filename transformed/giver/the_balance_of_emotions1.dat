9I read The Proper_Noun just a few days ago on the recommendation of a friend and found it to be one of the most thought provoking books I have read in years, and I read a lot! Lowry seems to be trying to show, in an extremely artistic way, that in order for an emotion to truly exist, there must be a balancing antithesis. For there to be love, there must be war. To truly experience beauty, you must also know repulsion. Jonas realizes that his family and friends have never truly felt pain or saddness or anger, and that makes him feel extremely alone. This "painfree life" is really nothing but a long gray death.\'The Giver\' is a challenge to you and to me, to the whole world, to never forget the memories. They are our responsibility to bear, and to share.I am 16 years old, an avid reader. I have forgotten more plots than I remember. I pray I will never forget this book.
