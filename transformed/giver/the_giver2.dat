19The Proper_Noun is a very suspensful book. It is a great book forall ages. I would reccommend The Proper_Noun to be put on a requiredreading list. It will intrigue you from the very first page to thevery last. The author did a great job keeping the reader interested throughout the whole book. The Proper_Noun is about a boy named Proper_Noun He lives in an ideal world. There is no pain, no worries, and no memories. Each person is assigned a certain role and that role is carefully chosen and well thoughtout . Each member in the community has to work in that job until they enter the house of the dead. When Proper_Noun is twelve years old he is assigned the most important role in the community. This role requires power, strength, and courage. This job also requires pain, and emotional feelings Proper_Noun may not be ready for. When Proper_Noun receives his training the world in his eyes is now seen in a different perspective. His world is no longer a perfect world. Proper_Noun now realizes all the things and choices he is misssing out on. This explores human\'s desire to live life to the fullest whether there are good things like pleasure and happiness or bad memories like war, hate and death. Proper_Noun realizes he is no longer happy and decides to do something very drastic. This decision could deeply impact the society Proper_Noun lives in. After reading this book it made me think in an entirely different way. I realized that even though I do not get to do whatever I want, I still have the freedom to make choices, and ultimately I can choose my own path. It helped me appreciate my world for what it is, and realize that in order to feel true happiness, sometimes it is necessary, as happened with Proper_Noun to feel pain, sadness, worry, and uncertainty. This book is the first book I have read that touched me to this extent. I hope many other people read this and get to experience what I have experienced.
