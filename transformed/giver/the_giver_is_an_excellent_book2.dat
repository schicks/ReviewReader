5The Proper_Noun is about a community that has no pain, no wars, and no hunger. Sounds like a perfect community, right? Actually, the community also has no feelings, assigned jobs, spouses, and number per kid. The community also lacks color and music. When children become 12 they are assigned a job. Instead of assigned, 12 year old Proper_Noun is "selected". This means he is givven the job of the Proper_Noun He receives memories of color, war, animals, and love. Proper_Noun is determined to share these things with the community, but how? Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun the only other person in the community who can see color, hear music, and who gives Proper_Noun the memories, devise a plan which could save or destroy the community. The Proper_Noun is a really great book, but I only recommend it for kids 11 years old and up, because it\'s really upsetting at times. All in all, a terrific book.
