506Jonas, an Eleven when Proper_Noun Proper_Noun opens, lives in a Proper_Noun where everything is meticulously ordered: houses look alike, people dress alike, each family unit includes a father and a mother (who can apply for one male and one female child). Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun assigns them their roles in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Because Proper_Noun people have chosen Proper_Noun nothing in their Proper_Noun is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices.The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun holds Proper_Noun position of highest honor within Proper_Noun Proper_Noun serving as Proper_Noun repository for Proper_Noun memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek Proper_Noun counsel and advice of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They have Proper_Noun benefit of experience without having to bear its pain.Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Proper_Noun to See Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is selected to be Proper_Noun next Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun The current Proper_Noun who has held Proper_Noun position for decades, then becomes Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun paints a vivid picture of this Proper_Noun Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called "newchildren," for example; children of Proper_Noun same age are "groupmates"; Proper_Noun elderly, Proper_Noun unhealthy, or those who have broken Proper_Noun rules three times may be "released."Why might parents or teachers consider Proper_Noun Proper_Noun inappropriate for their children? I can only speculate on this since I find Proper_Noun book profoundly original and commendable:1. The setting being a Proper_Noun without freedom. It should be noted, however, that citizens relinquished their freedom years earlier in order to escape Proper_Noun accompanying chaos. They are perfectly satisfied with their arrangement and are not oppressed.2. The family being depicted as a temporary sociological unit rather than a permanent socio-biological unit. Nevertheless, this family unit provides a very nurturing atmosphere.3. References to "Stirrings" (sexual arousal). These occur only a few times in Proper_Noun book and are only vaguely described. Since Stirrings are forbidden in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun young people begin taking a preventative pill upon first experiencing them and continue taking it daily until they enter Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The idea of young people bathing Proper_Noun elderly of Proper_Noun opposite gender. This happens only once in Proper_Noun book. It is a gentle, caring, and (given Proper_Noun ages of Proper_Noun participants) asexual experience.5. The concept of "release." This pervades Proper_Noun book, but its meaning remains uncertain until Proper_Noun 19, when Proper_Noun witnesses a release.I would think that for many readers these concerns would be assuaged by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun young protagonist who, in Proper_Noun course of his instruction, recognizes Proper_Noun advantages of previous systems and selflessly tries to better his Proper_Noun there are aspects of this Proper_Noun that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Proper_Noun is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of Proper_Noun characteristics of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that disturb us:Do we attempt to make our lives pain free?Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories?Do we use euphemisms?Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies?Do we have anything resembling Proper_Noun "House of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun we have a ritual that might be called a "Ceremony of Proper_Noun we attempt Proper_Noun Proper_Noun we avoid talking about ways in Proper_Noun we differ from each other?In our own Proper_Noun without a designated Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Proper_Noun memories will we receive? Proper_Noun will we give?
