244I have read The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun countless times and have always enjoyed it. I have listened to, and enjoyed, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun play" version, but this unabridged reading by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was far superior. To say that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun "reads" the book misses the point. He ACTS the book, and he is wonderful. Each character has his own voice, his own mannerisms of speech. The songs are sung and stories are told, not just read. By listening, you are cast into the world of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun You are along for each moment of the journey, each excrutiating step of the bearer\'s quest. Listening to this story read aloud brings the full richness and complexity of this timeless tale to life. It has been a wonderful experience. I know I will listen to this time and time again. Plus. . . It\'s worth the whole price just to hear Proper_Noun voice!!
