42In 1970 I read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun for the first time. It was like nothing Proper_Noun ever read, and it kind of spoiled fantasy for me ever since, because I started with the best and nothing else measures up Proper_Noun maybe Proper_Noun I\'ve read it pretty much every year since, including once out loud to my children. In 1978 my husband gave me the red-leather volume as a wedding present, and it\'s one of my prized possessions. I have other copies to sling around, but I keep that one at home to read carefully and reverently. I don\'t know if it\'s real leather or not, but it\'s certainly beautiful. Ringers call it the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun after Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun If I close my eyes I can call up the evocative smell of its pages, and see the beautful elven calligraphy in the margins. My husband also gave me the companion volume of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in green leather. If you get this book, you should get that as well.
