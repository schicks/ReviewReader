193My father introduced the late great Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Tolkien to me when I was 8 years old, at a time when I had an insatiable appetite for literature of all kinds. From one night to the next I used to long to hear of events that - somehow - had been happening during my daily absence."The Proper_Noun only added to my impatience. The animated tones of my father\'s voice as he described Proper_Noun Proper_Noun journey into the middle earth, created images of green mist, rugged mountains and dark woods that only a childs mind can see so vividly. Yet I can remember the look on my father\'s face as he turned every page to rejoin the adventure. And I realised that this book - this fantasy land - had captured my fathers imagination as it had mine.For years after my father read me Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I longed to recapture the feelings that I first encountered in Proper_Noun adventure - to learn more about Proper_Noun and conjure up further images of dark, mysterious scenery. But maybe that time was too special. Maybe Proper_Noun never mean\'t to find another book with such magical power Proper_Noun because maybe I was lucky to be introduced to one in the first place.There are a lot of maybe\'s in life - questions that go along unanswered - as there are in this book...... that\'s the magic.In my adult wisdom (!?) I now know that Proper_Noun never truly recapture the feelings that I had as a little girl. But - when the time arises - I will strive to provide the same atmosphere in which my children can realise the magic of reading. And Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the book that made me realise how important the magic is.So Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wherever you are, I give you 5 stars.... for the thousands that you have already given me.
