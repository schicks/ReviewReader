8This is a rather boring novel about a bunch of one-dimensional characters who are at Proper_Noun with a guy who lives in a tower. They are supposed to be good I think, and the guy in the tower is supposed to be bad. But as they all seem to have an equal penchant for fighting, and since we never get much insight into the tower-guy\'s personality or designs, it is hard to discern between them. Reading this book, I kept asking myself: Why couldn\'t the "good" just invite the tower-guy over for tea instead, maybe they could have become the best of friends?It is not that I dislike long novels. I love Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Because they are interesting and well written. The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun is not.
