201Note -- Proper_Noun work is rated 5 stars. The physical book is rated two stars.When you pay $100 list for a collector\'s edition book, you expect it to be perfect in all respects. I am on my 3rd copy of this edition and am still dissatisfied.The first book had paper that was poorly folded. There were many pages that were misfolded. I returned that and got another copy. This one had a whole signature Proper_Noun group of pages] with a tear at the top edge.I returned that and got a third copy. This one seems Proper_Noun but the pages are not centered in the hard cover. Its rather dissatisfying, but I think I will keep it.The publisher should take their printer/binder to task. Three strikes in three pitches is unacceptable for what is a very expensive edition to begin with.BTW all three copies had glue that overflowed onto the inside cover pages. When you try to separate the pages, they tear where the glue had been.I think that the publisher dishonors Proper_Noun marvelous work and insults their readers by publishing an expensive edition with such poor quality control.
