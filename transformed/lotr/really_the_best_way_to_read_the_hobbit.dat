544Okay, so I say that this is the best way to read The Proper_Noun And I am dead serious.I know that annotated books can be difficult to navigate, filled with useless, pointless, or just plain boring information, and can be grossly oversized. That is not the case here.So - here\'s the scoop.The original story is very nicely presented, with all original illustrations in color when possible, and in black and white elsewhere. The type is nice and clear, very easy to read. (Many cheaper editions are also rather hard on the eyes. Check the print before you buy, folks!)The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are.And then the annotations - useful, engaging, and very well done. You will WANT to read these. We discover how the book was written, and what was changed between editions. (There were many changes made so that The Proper_Noun would conform more easily to the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun trilogy.) There are fascinating tidbits about Proper_Noun life and the experiences that made their way into the story.The forward tells about the writing of the novel, and the appedices give additional details about the text.There are also many illustrations from other editions of the book. These are varied, from thought-provoking to not-provoking.And the book is not too big. Some editions are simply too big to be read, but this book is reasonably sized so that you can actually READ Proper_Noun In fact, I have not read any other edition of The Proper_Noun for years, since the original annotated version came out.The new edition is very much worthwhile. Enjoy!
