21Having only an old 1994 worn paperback edition of the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun I wanted to purchase a version that I could read and display for many years to come. I did a ton of research and decided upon this version (ISBN 116-1749849-2513827), illustrated by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun 2014 Proper_Noun am adding these details because the Proper_Noun site does Proper_Noun make it clear what this version is). Please note that this particular printing is Proper_Noun available in the Proper_Noun but any Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun devotee should Proper_Noun be deterred (Frodo wouldn\'t have been!). I must say that this is the finest published one-volume version of the Proper_Noun that I have ever laid eyes upon, and is well worth every penny. It includes approximately 50 high-quality color illustrations by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which even for a 30-something like me makes the reading experience exceptional. The front and back covers are made of durable, high-quality cloth Proper_Noun shown), with a strong and handsome turquoise binding. The pages -- Proper_Noun just the illustrations but the entire Proper_Noun -- are glossy and made of Proper_Noun paper than you generally find, the margins large, and the typeset easy on the eyes.For those who care about such things, the printing is based on the 2004 corrected text, with even further corrections. There are updated introductions/forwards by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Hammond Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun authors of the authoritative "LOTR Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as well as by Proper_Noun A. Anderson, who provides a detailed publication history of the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun The full appendices are included.Two-page red and black maps of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and of Proper_Noun adorn the front and back covers, with a map of the Proper_Noun before the first chapter. Also present are other essentials such as the Doors of Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun The only drawback is that the facsimile pages of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun was Proper_Noun included, which I found to be surprising and a bit disappointing Proper_Noun the ring inscription and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are printed in black rather than silver and red. Probably the main issue is the clear plastic slipcover, which is barely bigger than the Proper_Noun itself, and it is difficult to slip the Proper_Noun back inside it after taking it out. You are more likely to scuff the corners of the book. That being said, these are far from dealbreakers, and the joy to be received from owning this edition far outweighs these issues.
