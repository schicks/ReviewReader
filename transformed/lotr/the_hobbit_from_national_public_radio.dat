27This is the version produced by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a long time ago. This is Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun version, which is Proper_Noun an inferior product compared to this one. In fact, when I first bought this product, it was on cassette tape. I firmly believe that this version is the best audio presentation ever produced of tolkiens work. Why? Well, its really a voice character based play complete with ambient sound effects, it\'s theater of the mind set in tolkiens universe. It\'s Proper_Noun a plain old voice of one person doing his best to give you a read over like some grandpa reading a bedside story (not that i\'m against that mind you, it\'s just Proper_Noun my cup of tea, ya know). My kids grew up hearing this on long car trips, and it kept us all entertained with a shared universe we could all enjoy at the same time. My tapes had gone bad and I thought we would never be able to hear this great and wonderful audio play again. Lo and behold, its on CD and Proper_Noun has it. It\'s now playing behind me as I write this review and my youngest, home from college on break, is enjoying it with me. "In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit", go Proper_Noun go Proper_Noun go Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun
