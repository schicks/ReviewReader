186I just wanted to take the time to update anyone who is interested in purchasing this illustrated edition of The Proper_Noun As you probably know, there aren\'t many illustrated editions of the Proper_Noun and most that are illustrated aren\'t all that incredible. So far, my favorite edition has been the one by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I must say, it\'s hard to top his work. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun really helped bring the story to life for me when I first read this incredible adventure by Proper_Noun However, because I believe that The Proper_Noun is a tale directed at the hearts of children and adults that are young at heart, I believe that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun illustrated edition has topped even the great Proper_Noun Proper_Noun First off, the quality of this book is excellent. The book has been wrapped in cloth so the book feels high quality and soft to the touch. Also, the cover has a beautiful illustration from the book that includes carefully placed gold etching on the leaves, title, and author\'s name. This really gives the book a nice luster and shine. The book doesn\'t come with a book jacket and honestly I think that was smart based off of how high quality the book feels and looks. It just doesn\'t need a cheap paper jacket to cover such a beautiful looking book.The illustrations that are presented in the book are a thing of beauty. Not only are there a great many (every two or three pages or so) but they are incredibly colorful and really pop when you look at them. I do think the illustrator\'s style is to appear more colorful and simple at first glance, but at the same time you will look at the illustrations carefully and see the amount of time and effort that she put into this work. I love this style of simplicity and use of color. Though not the exact same style, I feel like it reminds me of illustrators like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who just have this incredible knack for bringing out amazing details with small illustrations. In fact, I truly and desperately hope that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun will be commissioned for Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun If you happen to read this Proper_Noun I just wanted to say thanks for putting so much passion and hard work into this book. I look forward to reading this to my children someday and plan on using your version when I do! As a side note, I should mention that some of Proper_Noun original maps are included in the front and back of the book.Lastly, it wouldn\'t be an appropriate review of The Proper_Noun without mentioning how amazing this story really is. If there is any part of you that believes in things like magic, risk-taking, adventure, friendship to the end, finding faith in the smallest of people or things, and good triumphing over evil, this is the book for you. I fell in love with the characters of this story and am thankful for authors like Proper_Noun Tolkien for having that God-given ability to captivate readers through these characters and the adventures they set out on. Every time I read this book I feel like Proper_Noun a kid again and that in itself is a great thing in my eyes. However, as an adult this book not only brings about those childhood feelings, but also strengthens my personal faith, and leads me to believe that those who truly live life to the fullest are those who go against the flow, take risks despite the fears or consequences when they know that it\'s in the name of doing what they feel is right inside of there hearts. I think there really is some of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in all of us and we learn a great deal from his adventure.If you cannot tell, I love this book. It is saying a lot for me that this is my favorite edition of the book so far. This truly is a high-quality, gift edition that you will be very proud to own. Don\'t hesitate to purchase! Thank you Proper_Noun Tolkien and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun
