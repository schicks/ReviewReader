6After hearing all the hype about the books and the movie, I expected a real classic. However, these books were more like a double dose of Proper_Noun I can\'t believe I wasted 12 hours listening to these. There are far too many characters and the books jump from sub-plot to sub-plot so often that they never established my interest in any one thread. There was no action or suspense. I didn\'t see the movie but can imagine that it may have been more interesting with the help of the visual effects. This story seems to be perfect for a movie....it needs some kind of help. As it is, it\'s far from exciting and a "Classic" it\'s definitely not.
