34Perhaps you will not believe me when I tell you that I have listened to this recorded book upwards of twenty times, but I have! I love Proper_Noun Tolkien\'s masterpiece, but when Proper_Noun adds his incredible powers of voice and rythem the book wraps you up in its spell. The voices he gives each character are distinct and lifelike; Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are all portrayed to the life. Every character is so real you can almost see them.Rob Inglis sings each of the songs Proper_Noun pack the books with life and color) with a nice, rich voice that does them justice. He makes the tense moments tense, the beautiful moments beautiful, and the tragic moments tragic Proper_Noun still cry when Proper_Noun falls in Proper_Noun seem alot to spend...but this audio book is worth Proper_Noun penny. I know the books almost by heart now...
