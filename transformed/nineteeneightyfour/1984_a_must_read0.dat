8George Proper_Noun book 1984, published in 1949, was an excellent book. I thought it was amazing that he used such imagination to come up with all aspects of this book. The fact that he wrote this book in the 40\'s and projected what life might be like in 1984 was very interesting. It makes you think. We think of 1984 as a punk era that is well in our past, Proper_Noun thought of 1984 as the future, the far off future. Just as we thought that the year 2000 was going to be filled with flying cars and people living on the moon and mars, he thought of 1984 in a very different way than it turned out. Or did he. He didn\'t have any way to perceive all of the technological advances we would make, but he did make some very good guesses. He talks about a machine that is in every room and on every street corner. This machine is called a "Telescreen." This machine watches and listens to every word and every movement you make. The local government watches this and will arrest you if you are caught going against the government. Saying anything bad will get you in jail. In the year 1984, according to Proper_Noun the world has been split up into three superstates Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is were Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun main character) lives. All of these superstates are run the same. They have a very strong central government that controls everything. These three states are constantly at war with each other and they have all created their own languages. The government in Proper_Noun is called Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This is where the phrase Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is watching you" came from. In these states no one is free and everyone is an enemy. People are raised on false beliefs that the government has told them. The goverment would even take it to the extreme and collect all the newspapers and rewrite them and burn the old ones if the papers stated beleifs that the goverment doesn\'t have anymore. That is what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun did. He was a a rewriter of documents. The government of Proper_Noun was one based totally upon mind manipulation. They used a term that they called "Doublethink" this was the power of holding two contradictory ideas in someones head and having them fully accept both. Big Proper_Noun raised all the people to be loyal to their government and be the government\'s slaves. The people saw this as being the way of things so they went along with it, having every second of their lives planned out and watched. Even people\'s children were more loyal to the government than their parents. Their was a scene in the book were a kid turned his parents in for speaking slander against the government. Even the language was cleansed and regulated. The government created a language called Proper_Noun "Newspeak" contained only words that were cleansed in thought. For example the word bad would be translated to "ungood." All in all, this book talks about the government and all the ways it is composed. But it does have a story line as well. The storyline is about Proper_Noun and this girl he meets named Proper_Noun They both have the same strong feelings against the government and they often meet in very crowded places where it would be hard for them to be caught talking. They finally decide to join an underground group against the government. They meet with this guy Proper_Noun who claims to be in charge. The story starts to unfold after that meeting. This was very good book. It was very deep and intense. I loved hearing all about the Totalitarian ideas the government practiced. Plus it was cool to hear what a man in the 40\'s perceived 1984 to be like. In a way he was right, we are constantly monitored by satellites and surveillance camera\'s. GPS systems and even cell phones. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun does exist just in a different way than Proper_Noun perceived him. But we also do have our freedom to think and speak. These are two things that the citizens of Proper_Noun 1984 did not have. But keep this in mind Proper_Noun Proper_Noun could be watching you right now.
