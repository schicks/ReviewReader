8Someone\'s watching. The government has you entrenched in a conspiracy so deep, where a national tragedy gave leadership the opportunity to seize all of your rights in the name of your personal protection. No, this isn\'t the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it\'s "1984," a dystopian Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the author of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Written in 1949, Proper_Noun hardly seems as dated as its title might imply. Really, nothing could be farther from the truth. The world set up by Proper_Noun over seen by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his invisible band of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has people political prisoners within their own country. Winston, a worker in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of one of the three ministries (The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun finds his mind resisting the world he\'s given, not completely accepting the "news" he\'s given, as well as doubting his contentment. He enters into a relationship, finds himself contacted by an underground resistance, and comes to discover some of the more dangerous traits of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is an extremely well written political masterpiece, which traces societal trends in an innovative and pessimistic sort of way.From the beginning, Proper_Noun introduces Proper_Noun touches of technology made from innovations in his time. Things such as telescreens (basically televisions with the capability to communicate with and spy on members of the outer party) and speakwrites (a microphone that transcribes dictations) give a modern sense to the novel, while keeping it somewhat futuristic, even in modern times. No extravagant inventions like space ships or teleporters are touched on, so there isn\'t a feeling of inaccuracy or over-optimism that seems to be common in more ambitious Proper_Noun Proper_Noun media. Honestly, I found myself wishing that something such as a speakwrite existed for homework assignments, or even writing this very review; however, I didn\'t get that overwhelming sense of Proper_Noun right, nothing like THAT existed in 1984" from the position of being here in 2007.Orwell brings out the political message of the novel most obviously by using the supposed revolutionary Proper_Noun book. The chapters from Proper_Noun book are inserted into 1984 as Proper_Noun reads them. Although these excerpts read something like stereo instructions or college dissertations, it really affirms the politics behind Proper_Noun writing. The three political bodies, or countries, in this novel consist of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Oceania includes the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun includes the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun includes Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The fact that Proper_Noun had the foresight to predict a lot of specific traits of world politics (such as the takeover of one Proper_Noun regimes in Proper_Noun and the escalation of current world politics (such as the arms race and the containment policy against the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun absolutely floored me. There were times when I was reading through sections of Proper_Noun history where I simply had to put it down, because some of the events supposedly taking place in the fifties and sixties I had just learned about in my history class as taking place around then. That in and of itself is not only brilliant, but very powerful; just knowing that the book predicted some of the things that happened gives more credibility to the more radical things Proper_Noun predicted. That\'s what\'s so strong about "1984;" there\'s this sense of "It could happen."SPOILER WARNINGS!Another strength of the novel was the relationship between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Although I personally didn\'t like Proper_Noun - (she struck me as a very odd sort of a rebel who didn\'t even seem to know what she wanted) - her character was perfect for the novel. Her quirky unpredictability and her complete disregard for authority showed how even the most seemingly active Proper_Noun members harbored deep reservations about the life they were living. Also, her somewhat shallow and lukewarm interest in politics was a good portrayal of the way people would begin to act after living under an oppressively totalitarian regime. It was admittedly strange to me how Proper_Noun was impressed by how many men Proper_Noun had managed to sleep with, but their relationship was still believable. Both of them had the fundamental desire to rebel against the system, and they channeled that towards sex. Fortunately, I couldn\'t personally relate to that, but it did represent a form of rebellion on Proper_Noun part against people who want to turn sex into a utility and take all of the pleasure out of it.The ending, however, was the most potent part of the novel. When Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are caught and tortured, and Proper_Noun describes the nightmarish ordeal Proper_Noun is put through, the reader really comes to understand how Proper_Noun develops. Throughout the entire novel, Proper_Noun progression from a nervous rebel, to a carefree rebel, to a penitent traitor was perfectly delineated by Proper_Noun After Proper_Noun suffers through his torture and decries everything- his distaste for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun his suspicion of changing information, his mental rejection of double speak- he becomes just another guy. Another drone under Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a man who loves and follows Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and works for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun At first, I admit I was disappointed. I kind of hoped for some sort of upset, a little sense of rebellion or even a feeling that something might have changed because of what Proper_Noun did. That lack of closure in that sense, however, was actually really good for the book though. It just shows how hopeless, how drone-like, how terrible an existence under a complete ruler can be, and how there really isn\'t any hope of the dystopian society changing after it has come in full swing. It really drove home that people should actively keep their most basic rights, and never let them slip away."1984" was one of the most contemporary feeling books I have ever read that was written before the 80\'s. It\'s well written, engaging, exciting and interesting, and provides intellectual fodder as well as personal enjoyment. There is suspense, love, and introspective thought, and the entire novel is building up towards the Proper_Noun twists on the end. Personally, I think Proper_Noun is one of the best of its kind, and was a better political metaphor than Alduous Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or even Proper_Noun own Proper_Noun Proper_Noun However, you\'ll never be able to look at your government the same again- Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is watching you.
