2Although I read this book years ago, I decided I needed a refresher since much is being said about it in the news today. My husband and I drove from Proper_Noun to CO this summer, and we took this little book along. WOW! We kept repeating, Proper_Noun happening Proper_Noun That\'s happening right Proper_Noun And with all the current Proper_Noun stuff in the news, all readers can\'t help but see the connections. The scary thing is that Proper_Noun wrote this book in 1949. How did he know? What link did he have to our current situation? That\'s the freaky part. Anyway, listening to the book made our drive a pleasure. We also listened to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and would recommend this as a companion to 1984. But be prepared: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is 50 disks long! Still... riveting! :)
