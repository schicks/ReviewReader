13Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun constructs a better sentence than most "literary artists"), the book\'s themes get more and more frightening as Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was in the days when 1984 was literally "the future," (even though Proper_Noun had always intended it as a satire on contemporary Proper_Noun with Proper_Noun the originally intended title); in Proper_Noun today the resonances are especially profound, and what looked "old-fashioned" to `sixties and `seventies sci-fi readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We\'re beginning to catch up with the US when it comes to presidential-style "leadership" and Proper_Noun whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the guilty denial of the achievements of the British Proper_Noun (whilst the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and Proper_Noun respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you can\'t say become thoughts you can\'t think, and an attempted conversation with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the reflection that we are so far from Proper_Noun one could weep; then I read 1984 again, where Proper_Noun has Proper_Noun wake up one morning with the name on his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It\'s also fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again, and read it to your children!
