2The last time I read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was in 1984. Then I was impressed with people disappearing in the night to become "unpersons", much like happened in Soviet Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Otherwise, it was so much futuristic fiction. Fast forward 30 years to today. We have NSA collecting our emails, "security" cameras on almost every light pole, and endless wars against nationless factions that vow to destroy us. The only thing lagging behind is the social engineering, but that is a work in progress. Big Proper_Noun is alive and well. This 65 year old book is a must read.
