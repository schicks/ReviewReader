2One of my favorite classics that Proper_Noun even though it is very depressing, recommend anyone interested in reading to read this book.Set in a nightmarish Proper_Noun of 1984 Proper_Noun we see life in a totalitarian state through the eyes of a single character, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who dares to standup against the notorious Proper_Noun notorious in our world Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in his own ways, through little defiant acts, such as keeping a journal stating his disapproval with his world and the government, to sneaking off and having sex with a woman for pleasure which is looked down upon as sex is only seen as a necessary for procreation.In this world, Proper_Noun was only attained through total obedience to the Proper_Noun and the love of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who watched you at all times. Proper_Noun works as a functionary of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun where history is rewritten to favor the Proper_Noun line summed up beautifully by the Proper_Noun slogan Proper_Noun controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." A little at a time Proper_Noun begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed. This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun today\u2019s technology, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a real threat and with the Proper_Noun growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future Proper_Noun if we are not careful.
