2A great read. It\'s well written and I plowed through it in one sitting. I could not put it down. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, and I pondered throughout the entire book. You know you just finished reading something great when you get towards the end and you start to panic because you don\'t want it to end. I thought all the characters were well flushed out and added something interesting to the story. I don\'t know how I can write a review without giving away the plot, so all I can say you need to read this. You won\'t regret it.
