14I have read this book many times before and I believe that 1984 by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun should be required reading in schools. This story helped change my life because Proper_Noun presents the story in such a realistic fashion that had me questioning what was real and if anything the government tells me is actually correct. I was captured by this book from the first sentence until the very last mind-blowing words. I definitely recommend reading this book if you\'re into anything that deals with politics, freedom, control and government. There is even a love story in the midst of all that is going on so if you like love stories this book is for you as well. When I finished reading, I set the book down and just said "Wow". If you want a good read that will have you thinking, pick this book up and have a go. I\'m sure you won\'t regret it.
