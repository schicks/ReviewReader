9It isn\'t happening exactly the way Proper_Noun thought it would but close enough for "government work" as they say. The few differences are covered in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun always tell my associates to take 1984 and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun toss them in a blender and then pour out the situation that exists today) as far as the covert aspects of a government controlled society (although the government didn\'t have to take over the media; the media is going along willingly without government control and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun keep people occupied doing ANYTHING other than contemplating the government)are being provided by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and a host of other distractions provided to preclude the population from observing much of anything outside the immediate sphere of their own existence. I purchase copies of this book whenever I spot them in a used book store and then hand them out like candy to co-workers and friends - just to get them to start thinking about what\'s going on now. After reading the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun from Proper_Noun and other "Founding Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it apparent that where we are today is nothing akin to where they would have envisioned us to be - it was "Promote the general welfare" not "give out welfare", "pursuit of happiness" not "make sure everyone is happy". We are where we are today by ignoring what\'s going on and allowing a government similar to the one\'s that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun predicted would develop. If you have yet to read this book then grab a copy and contemplate a further projection of the predictions; where is the control by the government over the "citizens" [subjects?] going to be in another ten years?
