11A lot of readers seem to miss the point of this novel (especially the people who gave it 1 star, that\'s just weak). It\'s not about Proper_Noun guessing what the world would be like in 1984 or really even a poke at communism. Proper_Noun presents an exaggerated and seemingly impossible not-so-distant future to the reader and supports it magnificently with parallelisms to religion and ideology. He addresses whether freedom of the mind is intrinsic to the human conscience and whether or not free thought is necessary for human happiness. It also questions what is real or true. Does 2+2=5? If you believe it and everyone else believes it, than why in the hell wouldn\'t it be so. The novel left me more afraid of the masses and the susceptibility of the human mind than the government. The people can take back control at the drop of a hat and they are the ones who allow it to get out of control in the first place.
