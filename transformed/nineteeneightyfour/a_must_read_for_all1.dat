12This is the most depressing tale I have Proper_Noun read. Though I know it to be fiction, I still can\'t take myself out of its ending. Although you KNOW for certain how the story will end, one could even imagine writing the plot exactly as it is only half way through the book, you could still not imagine the profoundness in which it was written and the mood it puts you in. It is also one of the most mentally exhausting reads. Taking you from logical absurdities to the haziness of dream worlds to metaphysical discussions.Ok, so why am I giving it 5 stars despite Proper_Noun this?Because in doing it the way it is, Proper_Noun has succeeded in transferring to you his absolute hatred of mental bondage, and of absolute unchecked human authority, and anything and everything that can lead to them. The rate at which the story is advanced towards the darkness and viciousness, the way he Proper_Noun for a moment leaves a prickle of hope in you heart or your mind about the final outcome of the protagonist or the world in which he lives, Proper_Noun reflect in no uncertain terms this hatred. Sometimes you think to yourself reading this "ok, I get it, why Proper_Noun this darkness"? Then, you realize what he was doing. He is shouting with the top of his lungs to Proper_Noun of us to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun let things even approach the conditions of "Airstrip one".What I have found most amazing in the novel towards the end is his resolution of a question that kept lingering in the protagonist\'s mind throughout the story; the "why?", why would the "Party" or the people in it do that? I have seen few reviewers allude to it. His answer was as simple and unexpected to me as it was to Proper_Noun - the protagonist, yet was perfectly inline with the extreme world Proper_Noun built. There is no "why", there is no logic to explain it. Power is an end, not a means. In the words of the party members: Proper_Noun is power". There is no reason for such attrocities but a sheer animalistic lust for power. Again, he is in a way saying: "don\'t Proper_Noun try to rationalize it to yourself or others".What sets "1984" apart from its famous sibling "Animal Proper_Noun which by the way was also very depressing, is that it is not tailored to the history of the Proper_Noun You could see, in a sense, the development of Proper_Noun thought while writing these two pieces. He started with the first to document one of the worst forms of collectivism that he witnessed, then - seeing at that time no sign of it being defeated or abated - took it to its extreme form. Such a form was sufficiently general to cover Proper_Noun types of mind slavery, to the extent that it can be applicable everywhere. I belive he might have even hinted at that in the part where he recounts the "history of the world" that he imagined from the his time to 1984. In this history, Proper_Noun of the globe, is ruled the same way albeit with different names and insignificant changes in ideology.It is impossible to read 1984 without drawing parallels between contemporary events and something that is taking place in the novel. Indeed, one might Proper_Noun find a place where this kind of world exists. Yet, there is always something to draw parallels upon. Here, in the Proper_Noun when you here the words "spin masters", you can\'t help but think of the principle of "doublethink"; in which one can not only muster the ability to consciously think of something and its opposite at the same time, yet somehow be able to believe both of them. You hear the word Proper_Noun reality" in which people hear, read, and see the facts yet still are able to fit them into their worldview. A view in which internment is justified, the poor are robbing the rich, dissent is treason, torture is patriotism, failures are successes, and everything you think is true is a lie fabricated by an enemy called Proper_Noun main stream media". Then, you can\'t help but think of the "Ministry of truth" and the "Ministry of love".Orwell is a champion of freedom at Proper_Noun levels, but most importantly in "1984", he is a champion of common sense."Freedom is the ability to say that two plus two equals four".1984 is a must read for all.
