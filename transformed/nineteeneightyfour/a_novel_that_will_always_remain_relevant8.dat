8George Proper_Noun has not only written an engaging and entertaining, (though sometimes depressing, but in a necessary way) dystopic-future novel; he has also given the reader both political and human insights. Although you won\'t find a happy ending in Proper_Noun masterpiece, the reader will enjoy the suspense of the dangers of Proper_Noun world. I could also sympathize with the romance between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun two lovers finding solace in each other while in deadly and dead surroundings. The prose is descriptive but also moves the reader along and lets the reader contemplate the book\'s political and human insights. Politically it is still very relevant. There are still toltalitarian governments and the situation that Proper_Noun suffers parallels not exactly, but is similair to the lives of many in third world countries with opressive dictators. It could even be used symbolically to satirize Proper_Noun Sometimes the government tells the press and the public lies. It has happened before. Think of Proper_Noun And to be fair to both parties Proper_Noun include both Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lies and the lies about Proper_Noun Humanely, it is a moving novel, showing man\'s inhumanity to man; the ability for a government to have such strength as to wipe out our signiture features: religion, love, freedom, and even language. (By this I mean Proper_Noun a form of writing the government imposes into the newspapers.) This is a bizarre, moving, heart-breaking novel about a negative-Utopia. I highly reccomend this book to thinkers, non-thinkers, or anyone who likes to read.
