16George Proper_Noun negative utopia has been a hugely important influence on our society. It is the root of cultural mainstays like \u201cBig Proper_Noun and \u201cdouble think\u201d, and has been required reading for millions of high school seniors. 1984 can be credited with encouraging a healthy skepticism and wariness of governmental overreach, depicting a worse-case scenario of what a totalitarian government may look like. Whether books like this have influenced Proper_Noun resistance to the ever-creeping advance of socialism can be debated, but the impact on shaping individual ideologies cannot be denied.We are blessed to live in a prosperous and safe nation, with strong limits on government and strong protections for individuals, but much of the world is very different. From Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun political opponents around the world mysteriously Proper_Noun conveniently) go missing all of the time. People live their lives under the constant and unyielding dictates of regimes that have only their own best interest at heart. The fear and helplessness so well presented in 1984 is felt in very real ways in the hearts of millions of people around the world today.But even living here in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I find much of this book eerily familiar. In an age of web-cams, smart phones, street cams, remote weapon-detecting machines, and databases of all sorts, it sometimes feels like we\u2019re living our lives under surveillance. The rise of political correctness, while based in good intentions, brings to mind Proper_Noun depiction of thoughtcrime. Hate crimes and hate speech have found their ways into our legal systems, and often in the name of diversity we are practically forced into an un-diverse, homogenous line of political thought. Anthony Proper_Noun adamantly maintaining before Proper_Noun that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun were not motivated by radical Proper_Noun clearly shows the real-life possibilities of doublethink. Inconsistent realities showcased by the Ministries of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun in 1984 remind me of incongruously-named legislation like the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun children in 1984 trained to root out and report incidences of thoughtcrime in their parents and other adults) remind me of stories about kids accusing their parents of killing the polar bears by being energy inefficient or by driving their SUVs. While we are obviously a long way from the horrific setting of 1984, there are ominous parallels to our own Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has long been a favorite of conspiracy theorists, and I can see why. Control the past to control the present. Who controls our education system, and who has to power to rewrite the past? Political correctness in history textbooks? You betcha! While I don\u2019t think it likely that we have anything like a behind-the-scenes Inner-Party pulling strings and intentionally repressing freedom, I do think there is a natural tendency of governments to grow more and more controlling. Even trivial-seeming or perfectly sensible-seeming laws can add up to a strictly regulated community. Even in our small towns. Want to cut down a tree? Better get a permit. Want to have a bonfire? Better get a permit. Want to build a house, dig a well, pave a driveway, put up a fence, drive a car, get a job, sell lemonade, buy a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun get a haircut, cook a meal? Where is government needed and where does individual responsibility start? It is a question that societies will always grapple with, but I think that unfortunately the default will typically go towards more regulation at the expense of freedom. In the name of protecting us from ourselves\u2026 well, I shouldn\u2019t too get carried away with this line of thought, but needless to say, this book really touched a nerve with me.1984 is by no means a light or fun read, but it is a read that will encourage serious Proper_Noun and reflection about the world we live in and the motivations of those in power. An emotionally powerful book that will draw you in, chew you up, and spit you out. And before the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun get too upset by my review here, I would like to assure everyone that I am very proud to be an Proper_Noun and I Proper_Noun my country. Even with our more and more limited freedoms.
