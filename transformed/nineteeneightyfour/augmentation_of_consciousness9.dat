8As I grow older, I recognize that my outlook on society and life as a whole has evolved. This change is not an immediate or an overnight change but rather a gradual shift that has occurred over months and years. These changes are the result of exposure to ideas.1984 is a book that is frequently referenced these days, by terms like "Big Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun After reading an article stating that "1984 is upon us" I decided that it was time for me to read this book to fully understand why "1984" was significant in any way and applicable in the year 2013.It only took me a little over 24 hours to read through this book. All depending on where you live in the world, you can download it for free because the copyrights have expired. If you live in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun you can certainly find an electronic copy online, however; to download it is illegal because the copyrights have not yet expired in the states.The book is fairly easy to read, after the first few pages I found myself immediately captivated and drawn into the world that Proper_Noun had imagined could be the future. I do not wish to spoil anything for you or plant any ideas in your mind about the value of this text, other than to say I expect it will change you.I highly recommend reading this.
