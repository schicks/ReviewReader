4George Proper_Noun is an accomplished author and 1984 is a classic novel written much before its time. Although much of what the world turned into within this story didn\'t occur, for the most part, I fear what Proper_Noun would say about the advacement in electronic surveillance and reduction in privacy today. I very much enjoyed this story and can easily relate much of the allusions of this book to today\'s society and it\'s possible future. However, I don\'t find the politics and geography of this story very realistic; the same for its primary ideologies. Yes, it\'s a work of fiction written over 60 years ago but for example it\'s unlikely Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for some reason) would ever side with Proper_Noun to make Proper_Noun any more than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would side with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to make Proper_Noun Geographically it sort of makes sense but politically it does not. The whole "Equatorial Proper_Noun discussion didn\'t make much sense either. The land area on/near the Proper_Noun is probably the least populated with the fewest resources in the world; though Proper_Noun not positive about that. I also felt that the chapter containing sections of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was much longer than it needed to be. That one chapter probably took up about a quater of the whole book, and it wasn\'t even real. The main character was tricked into thinking it was and even he claimed to not learn much from it. Granted this is the chapter that pretty much details Proper_Noun political ideologies for the world of 1984 but the same points could\'ve been in a more succinct manner which wouldn\'t sacrifice a thing. Aside from those points, and the fact that 1984 is incredibly depressing/pessimistic (I prefer at least neutral endings), I would recommend this classic book to any political, historical, or literature fans.P.S. The editors really need to go through this book again; it was full of spelling errors.
