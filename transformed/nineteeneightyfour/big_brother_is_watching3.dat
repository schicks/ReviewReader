5I\'ve recently finished reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and it has to be one of the best books Proper_Noun ever read. It\'s about the life of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who lives in a alternate future, where the world is ruled by power-hungry socialists who control every aspect of people\'s lives, right down to their very thoughts. Proper_Noun believes that he remembers a happier time before the revolution, when people were free, wars could be won, and laws dictated governments. He decides to rebel against the system, despite the threat of being killed, by starting a journal. This is definitely one of the best books Proper_Noun ever read. It offers insights not only into the possibility of a horrible future, but also into a confusing present. An example of this is how the book introduces the idea of "doublethink," a practice where a person holds two contradictory beliefs at once, and can still believe both. Orwell leads us to believe that this is but an evil communist idea, but in fact, he is satirizing the propaganda of our own "free world." All in all, I immensely enjoyed what is undoubtedly the author\'s biggest masterpiece, and would instantly recommend it to just about anyone.
