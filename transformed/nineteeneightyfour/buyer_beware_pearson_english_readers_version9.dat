2I had read this book in the past but needed to buy another copy for a class. I received the copy of 1984 that was the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun copy Proper_Noun knowing what that meant on the cover picture). This is Proper_Noun the original text, but rather a much shorter and more simplified version of the book. Nothing was stated about this text being any different than the original which it is listed under, so be careful when you purchase this.
