39Six years ago I was in a bookshop and on the shelf I saw a copy of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I had often heard people mention this novel on TV in political discussions and so on without really knowing what they mean\'t. Out of curiosity I decided to buy the book and see what it was like. I quite enjoyed it, and later that Proper_Noun we had to read it for Proper_Noun 12 Proper_Noun What I found interesting were the reactions of the other kids. Some liked it, others found it boring, uneventful or irrelevant. I remember one boy saying: "But 1984 was nothing like that!" The point about this novel is that it isn\'t supposed to be like a Proper_Noun prophecy. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was writing about the social conditions that existed at the time in which he was living. Shortages, censorship, government red tape and the manipulation of popular opinion. I\'m not overly concerned with the book\'s issues of politics or whether it\'s been proved inacurrate or not. I like to think of this as the story of an "alternative" 1984, a look at how different the Proper_Noun might be if history went in a different direction. Other books that explore this theme are "The Proper_Noun In The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun which are both set in worlds where the Proper_Noun had won the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun These books revel in historical inaccuracy. I think "1984" still has some relevance though. Especially the way the media alter people\'s view of the Proper_Noun by deciding what we should and shouldn\'t see, or the way newspapers "enhance" photographs. An example that comes to mind is when a newspaper altered a photo of the killer Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by putting more shadow around his eyes to make this ordianary-looking Proper_Noun look psychotic. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was right about the idea of people being under constant surveillance, now that hidden cameras abound, a device more subtle and unobtrusive than the telescreen. Even though we\'re not all wearing blue overalls and worshipping a demi god, free will is being undermined in a more insidious way. This novel has made an impact on other writers, particularly Proper_Noun Proper_Noun He wrote a novel called "1985". The beginning of that novel descibes his version of how the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun came about. This isn\'t a sequel, more of a reaction to the former book. In conclusion "1984" is an interesting book of a Proper_Noun that might have been, and might still be.
