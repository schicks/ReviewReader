20Orwell wrote 1984 at a miserable juncture in history. The Second Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had just ended, the Proper_Noun of his memory was in ruins, the full horror of the holocaust had been laid bare and the victorious powers seemed bent on completing the destruction the planet. The best of optimists would have quailed, and Proper_Noun was no optimist. Surrounded by this stark despairing landscape, he wrote a stark despairing speculation. It was his damning indictment of the dark places of our souls.It has been called a masterpiece; one of the twentieth century\'s greatest prophecies; a visionary dystopia that will speak for all time.I beg to differ.I do not question the brilliance of Proper_Noun writing. It exactly conveys the utter dejection and despair that he felt in the aftermath of the war. It is an incredibly taut development of character, theme, setting, and plot that strikes our psyche like a fist to the stomach. It attains exactly the right balance between storytelling and polemic.It is also all wrong. It felt wrong thirty years ago when I first read it. It feels just as wrong today.If we ever manage to create hell, it won\'t be Proper_Noun Humans are far more amenable to seduction than oppression. Why spy into every household when one can be persuaded to spy on oneself? Why use techniques as inefficient as torture when far more can be accomplished by appealing to our basest pleasures? Why need doublethink be forced when we will freely embrace it where it is invested with enough allure? And why would the denizens of a misbegotten future bother to listen to voices of discord when their every waking hour can be filled to excess with titillation, shallow ecstasy, and unending bombardment of the senses? The dystopia of the future will not be one of oppression, but of gluttony.An observant person, looking at the here and now, might conclude that hell has already arrived. But it has arrived via Proper_Noun not Proper_Noun We already have the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of test tube babies, mass pacification, casual sex, and broadcasted voyeurism. The key to keeping a society docile is to make docility so pleasant, so seductive, that we will freely and willingly embrace it over the rigours of a well-examined life. The road to hell is paved with syrup, not Proper_Noun was a brilliant thinker and writer, not just of fiction, but of social and personal commentary. His essays are probably the finest since Proper_Noun and his powers of human observation and his sheer intellect are overwhelming in their stature. This is what makes 1984 so difficult to understand. Such a keen mind should have arrived at very different conclusions from those exposited in this book.In a really hellish future, there will be no need to destroy malcontents; they will simply be irrelevant.
