12Depressing stuff and quite emotional, considering that I have experienced some of this dismal world for 18 years (xUSSR). On the other hand it is very much up-to-date. People are getting brainwashed today. Yesterday, absolutely everybody believed in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and if you didn\'t you were an enemy. Then in a blink of an eye Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mutated into Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Again, everybody believes in it. They don\'t understand it, but they believe in it. They don\'t question it. They no longer have an ability/brain power to do it. They blindly believe/trust someone who allegedly knows more. Some who have retained the ability to question are the enemies. How many scientist who dared to voice their disbelieve in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun were booed down by their colleagues and had to quit?It is but one example.That\'s life, isn\'t it?
