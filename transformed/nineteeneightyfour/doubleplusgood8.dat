24George Orwell\'s 1984 is unquestionably one of my favorite novels, if not my favorite (and not merely because the title is my birth year). Powerful and enlightening, it offers the reader a glimpse into a society in which the omnipotent Proper_Noun controls the populace through manipulation of language, alteration of the past, and other devices. With a population composed of brainwashed Proper_Noun members and apathetic proles, the zeitgeist is characterized by contented and unthinking servitude to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Yet Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (committing an odious, illicit act) begins to think negatively of the status quo, giving the basis of this thought-provoking novel. Admittedly, one section (but only one!) becomes a bit tedious, Proper_Noun book. Keep reading! The immaculate third chapter soon follows, culminating in the most effectual ending that I have ever read. Its impact proves that Proper_Noun successful captivated the reader throughout the novel. I wonder, considering that literature as chimerical as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun gains placement as non-fiction, if 1984 has been incorrectly categorized. It would not surprise me if Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had used this novel as a guide book. Of course, elements are also apparent in modern American society, from the welfare Proper_Noun to political correctness to surveillance devices. The advice I give to the prospective reader is this: quit reading reviews (in a worst case scenario one might learn the ending) and read 1984!~pythia~
