3I read this book the first time in 1984 &amp; it was on of those books that stays in your head. Back then it was because of the technology Proper_Noun created. Telescreens, memory holes and Proper_Noun blew my mind. Now it is the fact that I now know the evil that men have done, and will continue to do, all for the sake of power. This book is not a novel as much as it is a life lesson for all us 94 percenters. If you\'re OK with letting the government tell you what, when, how much of anything you can have in your life then progressivism is the way to go. As for me, Proper_Noun die happily with a gun in my hand defending my 84 oz big gulp.
