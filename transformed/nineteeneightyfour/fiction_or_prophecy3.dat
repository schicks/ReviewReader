57Winston Proper_Noun member of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a small, petty cog in the great machination of "Big Proper_Noun tries to step out from the shadow of his life in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun now masterpiece, "1984". Written over 50 years ago, this book was to serve several purposes, one being a warning to the present that a future like this, however fantastic and unbelievable, could be in the making should we allow for it to happen.Winston leads the dull life of a worker, not encouraged to think, or dream, for feel for himself. His whole life must be driven to support the Proper_Noun which promulgates an apparent non-entity Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as the supreme one. Proper_Noun early on shows the spark of individuality that the Proper_Noun so wants to extinguish; by daring to write a journal on his own, he seals his fate early in the story. Soon he meets Proper_Noun another worker, who charms and dares him even further to enocurage having an affair. Together they make a lethal pair, and some lethal decisions, which leads to the great climax in the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun lies in the story is an amazing prophecy of government gone mad. The Proper_Noun believes in creating present truths by writing and rewriting the past on its whim. The Proper_Noun understands in order to control the people, it must control the language, thereby, creating Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun makes people simply vanish, eradicating them from existance. The Proper_Noun realizes the people who follow are merely plebians in society, and therefore, should be encouraged to not think for themselves. In fact, the Proper_Noun is able to directly lie to the people, using "doublethink", where they say one thing but mean the other.How much of Proper_Noun nightmare is something that can be true today? Do we have a government out of control, one that manipulates information for its own benefit, to justify war, ensure fear and terror reigns over the country; one that illegally detains people without trial, right to counsel, or even being charged with a crime; one that wants to extensively monitor our personal phone calls, e-mails, the books we check out of the library, the things we buy in stores. The dots are there to connect them; the challenge is, will you dare to do it, like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun dared?I believe 1984 is ultimately a hopeful book. Orwell wants to challenge humanity, that during times of crisis, we are able to rise up and change things, so the fateful prophecy so nobly and horrifyingly espoused in 1984 , will only stay between the covers of the book. The choice is up to us.
