5No amount of positive reviewing will do justice to the importance and beauty of this book - you have to read if for yourself. What I really want to review are the reviews of some reviewers from Proper_Noun countries. They like the book, but their reviews are of the kind \'This is a book about a hypothetical totalitarian dictatorshp, Proper_Noun etc.\' What is wrong, is the word \'hypothetical\' This book could have been titled \'Bits of the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (albeit a little allegorical)\'I don\'t know what people born in the Proper_Noun understand in this book. Not much perhaps. The very fact that Proper_Noun is the ONLY Proper_Noun I know of to have written an accurate description (though a bit allegorical) of communism in practice, suggests that most Westerners couldn\'t understand what was happening in the Proper_Noun world. I suggest that they read it for what it is: Proper_Noun cast into an allegorical novel.Now an example or two. There was a famous picture in Proper_Noun textbooks in Proper_Noun countries. Proper_Noun in a podium holding a speech, his hand streched to the masses listening. On his left you could see Proper_Noun Everyone of my age has seen this picture. What most people haven\'t seen, though, is an older version of it: Proper_Noun holding a speech, and on his left, Proper_Noun (Winston\'s job right)Now my country (Albania) was great friends with Proper_Noun until 1961, that is. Albania broke up with Proper_Noun (considering Proper_Noun a traitor of real socialism), to advance real socialism together with Proper_Noun Not for ever of course - in 1978 Proper_Noun became a traitor of real socialism, too, having in fact never been really socialist. There was a famous picture in Albanian Proper_Noun textbooks. The Albanian Proper_Noun (Enver Proper_Noun was denouncing the betrayal of real socialism by the Soviet leadership. I have seen all three versions of this painting: In the first one, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had Proper_Noun Proper_Noun on one side and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (Albanian Proper_Noun Proper_Noun on the other. This was valid between 1961 and 1978. When Proper_Noun betrayed socialism in 1978, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun disappeared from the painting, and someone else took his stead. This second version lasted until 1981. That\'s because in 1981 Proper_Noun Proper_Noun became a traitor, and Proper_Noun suicided\'. So he disappeared from the painting, too. This is the last version of it. By the way, the painting stood in the Albanian Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Many people must have seen all three versions of it in original.I could wrie a book longer than 1984, describing how accurate 1984 is.Read 1984 as a Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun world; it is valid even for the four decades after Proper_Noun death.Aleksander Coho
