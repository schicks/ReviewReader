5I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report. I\'ve never been able to forget it. It\'s the haunting account of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun an employee of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun who hasn\'t forgotten the past, and who wants to change the future.However, Big Proper_Noun is watching him. Try as he might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the government.Published in 1949 during the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun puts a spin on communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold. I shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Proper_Noun even in the slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read. Let\'s hope we never come to this.
