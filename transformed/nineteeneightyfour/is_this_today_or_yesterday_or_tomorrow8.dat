1Having read this as a college freshman in 1962, I remembered the general concepts, but not the specifics of this novel. I was drawn to reacquaint myself with Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as a result of the political and societal events of today. Although it was to have happened in 1984, it\'s tone and the level of control it describes is not far off from the direction we seem to be headed. NSA, Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun our court system, and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fit in very nicely.
