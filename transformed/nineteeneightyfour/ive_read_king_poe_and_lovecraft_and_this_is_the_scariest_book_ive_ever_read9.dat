1I believe \'1984\' is standard reading for many high school/college Proper_Noun classes, but it wasn\'t in mine. I decided to read it on my own this summer, and boy am I glad I did.1984 tells Proper_Noun story of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a man who lives in Proper_Noun totalitarian government, wants to fight back, and isn\'t entirely sure how. He is watched almost all Proper_Noun time, must be constantly on guard against showing dissent from Proper_Noun party, or else he will be disappeared. While he and similar characters aren\'t exactly brimming with personality, they don\'t need to be to make this book good.The greatest thing about this book is Proper_Noun government itself. A common saying in this book is [paraphrased] \'he who controls Proper_Noun past controls Proper_Noun future, and he who controls Proper_Noun present controls Proper_Noun past\'. Orwell goes into detail on how to accomplish this, and delivers on all of Proper_Noun horror, both stated and unstated, that goes along with it. The even more classic line Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun is brought up, and explained in such a way that I even found it plausible in a severely twisted sort of way. And Proper_Noun worst part? All of this misery, terror, and oppresion? It\'s entirely believable that it could happen to us. The government doesn\'t need any sci-fi tech to take absolute control, and they don\'t need it. Heck, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is doing something similar right now!One minor thing I have to say I like is Proper_Noun prose. A lot Proper_Noun book Proper_Noun read that are sixty years have a lot of archaic grammar and word choice. 1984 doesn\'t for Proper_Noun most part.I recommend this book to anyone interested in classic literature, second only to \'Catch-22\' in my list of books you should read. So, you know, buy it.
