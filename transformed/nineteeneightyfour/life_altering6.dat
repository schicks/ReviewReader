41Here is the book that first got me thinking about politics and philosophy.This is Proper_Noun dystopia of how he feared the world would become run by a group of cahooting despots by 1984.The main character, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lives in Proper_Noun in a dictatoeship run by "big brother". In this state there is no love but love for big brother. There is no excitment but patriotism. Chocolate is rationed and orgasms are banned. In this world smith somehow manages to fall in love.. and that\'s just the start of his problems.1984 warns us to be wary of those who might take our freedom whilst trying to convince us we are actually gaining extra liberty. Buy it.
