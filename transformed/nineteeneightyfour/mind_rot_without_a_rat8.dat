25That is what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun warns us against in his bone-chilling and now increasingly accurate description of a world of revisionist history and massive invasion of privacy, abetted by technology to produce a society of conformity and fear.Borne out of Proper_Noun personal experiences in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun present day, repressive Proper_Noun and his observations of totalitarianism at mid-Twentieth Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the story of an average bureaucrat of middling intelligence who seeks no more than to be a whole man who can think and speak his mind, display passion outwardly, and not lie awake wondering who may be watching him. Paranoia rules. Proper_Noun gives us a riveting, sometimes grotesque explanation of what it finally takes in Proper_Noun for one man to try to restore whatever remains of his genuine identity and self-respect.Since the first publication of this timeless work around 1948 (reverse the digits, you\'re through the looking glass), Proper_Noun philosophical sentries have made a point of looking for examples in recent history to prove how prescient he was, and those signposts abound. For example, in the Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun was renamed the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun (Newspeak), a soldier in Proper_Noun had to "destroy the village to save it" Proper_Noun certain municipal hate crime legislation was enacted to curb the utterance of mean-spirited language short of action, and law enforcement officials began publicly naming so-called "persons of interest" and spending years tracking their activities under the microscope of media coverage. Later, opponents of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun were branded by the government as unpatriotic Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Overseas, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun continue to feud over the existence of the Proper_Noun with one government staging a conference to help prove it didn\'t exist while Proper_Noun threatens an anti-Semite with prison, raising the nettlesome issue of to what degree free speech should be curtailed in the name of community stability as defined by government."1984" does not have a happy ending. Its last four words slam the book shut on freedom. Proper_Noun hoped to foment enough concern with his masterpiece to influence the course of history, and he has to some degree succeeded. There are millions of people around the world who have yet to taste true freedom and who will not relent until they have acquired it. There are others who constantly observe Big Proper_Noun latter-day Proper_Noun who gird each day for a fight to defend individual liberty.A quarter-century after the real 1984, the public and private sectors, enabled by technology, have made it easier to know what the public is saying, thinking, and feeling. And in our own discourse as individual citizens, some of us have taken to playing fast and loose with the facts, or retreating from the world of terra-firma into a make-believe electronic neighborhood.Will we, as a people, accept the "truthiness" of a Proper_Noun posting, manufactured definitions on Proper_Noun or be content to have high-powered computer algorithms track our Proper_Noun footprint in the name of consumerism? Will we retreat to our iPods and virtual reality games? How well will we pay attention? How much do we read? What do we read? And when are we willing to speak up, and to whom?"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance". - Jefferson
