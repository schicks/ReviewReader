1This marks the third time Proper_Noun read this book (previously in 1989 at the age of 14, and again in 2007).One of the most important novels ever written, but also one of the most depressing (though the tone and manner in which the Proper_Noun is written does offer the reader a wee-bitty glimmer of hope). More frighteningly relevant than ever: on the one hand, sure, thankfully, 31 years after "1984" was supposed to have taken place Proper_Noun 67 years after it was actually written), democracy and capitalism still exist, and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has collapsed; on the other hand, seeing how even in the free-market democracies, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has gotten more and more intrusive into private citizens\' lives (see the Proper_Noun surveillance scandal in the Proper_Noun the presence of Proper_Noun cameras on practically every street corner in Proper_Noun the ability of spy satellites in geosynchronous orbit thousands of miles above the Earth to take close up shots of people and property alike), not to mention any idiot with a camera phone to record your activities and emulate the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun book, and it becomes readily apparent that the technological potential for a Proper_Noun Brother-type omnipresent superstate is stronger than ever. The year 1984 may have come and gone, but lovers of civil liberty need to be more vigilant than ever in this day and age, and reading Proper_Noun book helps to drive that point home.
