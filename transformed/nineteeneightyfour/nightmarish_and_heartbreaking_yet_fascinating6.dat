4In a world where political religion reigns, Proper_Noun is replaced by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (the all-seeing, all-knowing government) and an invisible leader, known by the images projects on the tv screens. History is rewritten by way of consensus - whatever everyone believes is deemed as truth. I am reminded by the quote,"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." This speaks to the corruption that can result from a search for power, where personal power becomes powermongering over others. It also implies the power of belief over the mind and the struggle between the individual and the group consciousness. The ending is utterly tragic and the coldbloodedness of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun shocked me to the bone. I have read this book a few times and would strongly recommend it to anyone wishing to see the danger that may result in giving up one\'s freedom for security and the ability to think for oneself in return for comfort. Here, "ignorance is bliss."
