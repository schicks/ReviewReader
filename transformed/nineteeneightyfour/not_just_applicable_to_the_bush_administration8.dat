8Many of us use Proper_Noun book for our own purposes, to forward our own ideas and political positions. Even though Proper_Noun was speaking quite specifically about a particular socialist experiment, communism, and a particularly horrible totalitarian gulag-state - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - his book has such a universal scope that it can be squeezed and pushed and pulled about until it can be made to fit almost any political system anywhere. In this way great works are often de-constructed to make them useful to whomever wants to make a point.A lot of us here are likening the world of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to current life in the Proper_Noun While there are definitely elements of this overreaching intrusion into our private lives today in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun be aware of how much farther down that road so many other countries have already gone Proper_Noun down which we are very unlikely to go). Start with the Proper_Noun nations where the Proper_Noun exort the masses to their Two Minutes Of Proper_Noun towards us every Proper_Noun in the mosques. In Proper_Noun under a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun right now, there are not only surveillance cameras - called Proper_Noun cameras - on virtually every corner in the cities, they are now beginning to install microphones as well ([...]) starting in the council flats. They directly say it is to monitor "anti-social" behavior. This is the insidious beginnings of Proper_Noun Well past what we are enduring and in the very country from which Proper_Noun sprang and from which our own ideas of civil liberties originated.In all the world\'s dictatorships, from Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to virtually all the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun there is one version or another of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They may be religious police as they are in Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They may be undercover military police as they are in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun They may just be your neighbors, as they were in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for all we know, still are to some extent, at least). But in all these places the horror of Proper_Noun vision is much more advanced than in the Proper_Noun People actually are killed. In Proper_Noun there are still 275,000 "disappeards," people who simply ceased to exist under the brutal totalitarian regime of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun himself a great admirer of Proper_Noun (I didn\'t make that number up, btw, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun did) If you want more proof, just ask a Palestinian homosexual about what constitutes "anti-social behavior" in the Proper_Noun Actually, if you want to ask a Palestinian homosexual that question you will have to go to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun because that is where they all live. Palestinian gays are either dead, in prison, or in Proper_Noun might be well advised to also be aware that in many other places in the world the true reality of 1984\'s dystopic vision has been in place for decades, and citizens continue to suffer real torture, imprisonment, and death for things which Americans take for granted as being protected under our Proper_Noun Yes, there are some egregious violations that are going on here under the guise of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but they are constantly under fire from our own legal system and from private Proper_Noun and civil liberties watchdogs. Imagine having these kinds of groups in, say, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun instant imprisonment - just ask Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun What is going on here is nothing when compared to the terrors vistited daily upon millions of people around the world who would only love the chance to come to this country. I don\'t suspect any of them would think they had strayed into Proper_Noun 101. ekw
