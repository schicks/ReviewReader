6Having just read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and some other books for school, I can honestly say that 1984 by Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun scariest, deepest, most interesting, and undoubtedly Proper_Noun best book Proper_Noun ever read, with Proper_Noun possible exception of Proper_Noun OF Proper_Noun Proper_Noun When I started it, I couldn\'t put it down. When I finished it, I couldn\'t pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after Proper_Noun finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can\'t sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It\'s ten times scarier than any Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel, and it\'s at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in Proper_Noun entire Proper_Noun living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing Proper_Noun ever read which even comes close to projecting Proper_Noun kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes Proper_Noun reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can\'t be treated lightly. It will send you to Proper_Noun edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it\'s not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You\'ll never hear Proper_Noun phrase Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is watching you" again, without chills going down you\'re spine, and fear filling every corner of your being. You must also read Proper_Noun OF Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for another chilling portrait of society gone wrong.
