221984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of Proper_Noun literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Proper_Noun is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Proper_Noun Proper_Noun resistance against Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun symbolic leader of the Proper_Noun and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars.
