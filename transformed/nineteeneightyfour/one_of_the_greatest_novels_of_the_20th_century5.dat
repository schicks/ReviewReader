2It\u2019s easy to dismiss Proper_Noun masterpiece as a quaint and dated dystopia, a banal nightmare of the future cobbled together in 1948 out of the dingy present and the recent past: the bombed out Proper_Noun of the novel looks like nothing so much as that city under the blitz. The scarcities and rationing, the war frenzy, the propaganda and paranoia required no imagination to describe. They were right in front of him. Critics use Proper_Noun merciless reportorial skill as a brief against his imagination. His grim fantasy is all too realistic. It fails both as fantasy and prophesy. The titular date has come and gone, they point out. The Proper_Noun is not divided into three super powers perpetually at war; no telescreens invade our privacy. No all-powerful totalitarian state controls our lives, which are in fact more free and prosperous than anyone could have imagined at the bleak and dreary end of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Of the computer and the internet, plausibly the most significant new developments since that time, Proper_Noun had not an inkling. But this superficial reading of the book, whereby we comfort ourselves with the fact that we drink Proper_Noun Proper_Noun rather than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is tragically naive and misguided. In fact every basic concept, every philosophical and political development Proper_Noun addressed in his book has come to pass almost exactly as described.Orwell analyzed the way people driven by the need for power actually think. This is the most useful insight in his book, delivered by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seeks power entirely for it\u2019s own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury, or long life or happiness: only power, pure power \u2026 We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture \u2026 How does one man assert his power over another? \u2026 By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering how can you be sure he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face Proper_Noun forever.\u201dTo this bleak vision the battered and terrified Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has one reply: \u201cSomehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.\u201dOf course in the novel it is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who is defeated and obliterated, after learning to love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The story is unrelenting, a harsh tragedy in which the human spirit is crushed, and the future is too horrible to contemplate. The good guys lose. They are forced to betray their deepest beliefs and emotions, gutted of their souls and left to wander the streets like hollow eyed ghosts. Evil wins, over and over again, with a shriek of glee and blare of military music. The book ought to be profoundly depressing And yet it isn\u2019t. Just the opposite: it\u2019s uplifting, thrilling. It\u2019s a form of meta-text: the fact that you are reading the book at all, the fact that the book was written and published, confounds the darkness of its message. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun knows no one will ever read his journal \u2026 but people will be reading the novel that contains it for as long as books exist. The authors of the Proper_Noun dictionary exult in the destruction of language; the mandarins of the inner Proper_Noun continuously dismantle all passion and morality and truth. But the novel itself, with its vivid prose and ferocious probity creates an exhilaration, a giddy hope in the reader that its characters can never share. A masterpiece. Read it. If you\'ve already read it, read it again.
