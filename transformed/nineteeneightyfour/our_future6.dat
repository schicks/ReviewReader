5This is the best science fiction story I have ever read. George Proper_Noun constantly had me on the edge of my seat never knowing whether the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would catch Proper_Noun expressing his opinion. I really liked the way Proper_Noun writes this book as if 1984 was such a distant future. It makes me think if our forms of government worldwide are getting to that point. This novel really made me think about how corrupt our government is and how they can do just about anything they want as in the story. Proper_Noun also constantly uses great description. This line in particular I really enjoyed, "Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere." I loved the way Proper_Noun gave this description of Proper_Noun it makes me see such a colorless world with no sign of any emotion. There were certain aspects that had me confused however. Orwell\'s use of huge vocabulary had me confused at times and I would read many paragraphs over to get the full understanding. However it is good for yound readers such as myself to learn many new words. Proper_Noun gave his knowledge about how our government today, isn\'t that far off as in the government in the story to millions of readers. This novel made me better understand on how things are setup in our society and how we as people need to understand that the government\'s power is a problem.I highly recommend this novel to everyone. - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun
