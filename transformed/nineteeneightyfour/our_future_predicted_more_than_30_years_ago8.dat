2I read this book long before the year 1984. It was horrible, but an accurate picture of the future. Unfortunately, we are living Proper_Noun now. It came true far faster and it is more sinister because most Americans don\'t realize this kind of government with its fingers and ears and successful propaganda is already here; we are already living the life of "1984."Every American should read this book, and be in awe of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for having predicted the life of having our every ounce of privacy encroached by the government. The Proper_Noun is worse than Proper_Noun but Proper_Noun is never far behind.
