7To me it is somewhat surprising how few people think this is a book about perception and how that perception can be circumvented and subverted by the use of semantics. This should be obvious since Proper_Noun actually takes the trouble to stop the book in mid-stride and lecture the reader about things like Proper_Noun Jane Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is also a book about perception, so much so that one of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun editions has an entire introduction devoted to this idea. This is why Proper_Noun book is still so timely and why "1984" is more timely than ever.The liberal Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun has had it\'s ability to reason literally overwhelmed in some instances by it\'s own political agenda. If Proper_Noun could have Proper_Noun sure he would have coined the phrase, "political correctness". Political correctness blinds a person to any solution that does not fit in with their world view and so Proper_Noun has become a very troubled place indeed; in Proper_Noun rape by one group can be the result of \'generational rage\' and by another a predatory crime. Crime itself becomes politicized according to skin color. Words like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun have had to be redefined by the Proper_Noun in order to portray Proper_Noun in the light they wish. On the Proper_Noun it is taken for granted that all cultures are equal, separated only by opportunity and not by an inherent brilliance or lack of it; the benefits of multiculturalism, as a result, are taken for granted and not to be even questioned and Proper_Noun immigration policy reflects this tenet.The political Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun in the 21st century has taken on the delusional aspects of the Proper_Noun in the 1960,s, seeing what it wishes to see and deriding all else with an airy, moral wave of the hand. Obsessed with race, the Proper_Noun projects its own obsession with skin color onto millions of white Americans it doesn\'t even know.The Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun projects it\'s own oppressive and smothering presence onto the country as a whole in the name of political freedom while absolving Proper_Noun criminal oppressors of guilt; it is the \'system\' that is guilty and the Proper_Noun criminal. Criminals become heros, and lack of achievement celebrated in patronizing asides while success itself is deemed immoral without regard to the intent of the opposite side of that success. Thus failure attains morality in an Orwellian way that is most troubling. The Proper_Noun assigns morality wholesale in stereotypes that consign a banker to spiritual bankruptcy and a college student the opposite in a bigoted default system totally unaware of it\'s own racism and lack of perception of reality.The political Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun is caught in the very perceptual trap that Proper_Noun warned about; that trap is insidious and blinds one to it\'s very walls.Lack of achievement in Proper_Noun on the part of certain groups in relegated to a concept of a generational hangover while achievement is deemed a result of privilege; in the eyes of the Proper_Noun both groups are in fact exactly equal in terms of competence.In Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun would have you believe that everyone is exactly equal, the "dictatorship of the proletariat" as it were in not a class struggle but an evening out of class, based on the Proper_Noun woulda, shoulda\' view that there must be a reason why some groups achieve and others do not aside from their own endemic value system or lack of it. In this scenario success itself achieves a type of tainted corruption while lack of success is to be excused, examined, mitigated and measured in every possible way but what counts and that is as Orwellian as it gets."Big Brother" isn\'t watching everyone, just those it deems watchable by skin color, success and and entirely de-contextualized cultural history every bit as subversive as Proper_Noun job.
