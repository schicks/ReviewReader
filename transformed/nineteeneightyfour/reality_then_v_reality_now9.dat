8You\'ve probably already read the other reviews on this site, so i\'ll just concentrate on my opinion on the relevance of this book in our contemporary society1984 is a stark warning against totalitarianism. Written in 1948, Proper_Noun depiction of a government-controlled society seemed absurd when published, contrasting the imnumerable amount of people that\'ve said how real it seems now than it did then in western societyOne interesting factor is the geography of the planet. We are told very little and all we\'re told is that there\'re three \'super-states\', Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Oceania is constantly at war with a vague and distant enemy, and is always switching between being allies and enemies with Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Comparing it to today, just what is this \'war on terrorism, and how threatened do you really feel about it (disregarding media opinion)?. America and Proper_Noun both independantly throughout the years and in allegiance with each other recently, are constantly at war with an enemy. WWI, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun war I and more recently Proper_Noun war Proper_Noun Societal opinions + perceptions are influenced by media, but who are we at war with? The "War on Proper_Noun clearly highlights the fact that there is no tangible enemy anymore. Explained more clearly in Proper_Noun passage in the book, we are constantly at war because it keeps us united, and stops us fighting one another, stops us fighting the government.Another interesting factor in book is the issue of government surveillance. \'Telescreen\' in homes, Proper_Noun everywhere you walk, Microphones even in the countryside to detect rebellious behaviour. Although key issues stated in the book aren\'t as extreme, the power the government now has to keep tabs on people and spy on them has reached limits it has never reached before. The Proper_Noun explain that this surveillance is for the benefit of the people Proper_Noun animal farm) and they constantly reassure the citizens, or \'comrades\', that life was worst off before they came along. Similarly, our governments are constantly re-assuring us how much better our lives are because of them. I.D cards are being proposed under the pretence that they will \'eliminate terrorism and benefit fraud\', which are something the people are \'persuaded they want\' because they media tells them they do.The third, conclusively and i think most importantly, is the way this book challenges the fact we (society in 1948) take our freedom for granted. One passage in the book which sticks out in my mind specifically is when the main charactor walks through a lower-class area, and is terrified that the police patrols might stop him and ask him questions; \'what are you doing in this part of town? is this your usual way home\'? etc. Similarly, if someone was walking down the street at 2am in a dangerous part of town for no particular reason, it would be deemed socially strange, thus encouraging this person not to do so, and do what everyone else does. If someone dresses in clothes that you do not usually see, he/she would be regarded as a weirdo, a social outcast".My point is, how free do we really think we are as a society these days? How easily are we opinionated by the media?Our society is edging closer and closer to the reality that is 1984, and i recommend that you read it, it will change the way you perceive news articles, and you\'ll question all these erosions of civil liberties that have been happening.By the way, Proper_Noun didn\'t intend for this vision to be reality in the year 1984. He wrote it in 1948, so he just switched the last 2 letters around.
