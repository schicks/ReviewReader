5This excellent book is about life which was deprived of all meaning, whose primary goal was a constantly increasing productivity motivated by an ingeniously designed social system that advocated Proper_Noun and peace."I was born in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun I recall the anxiety that tormented my family during the preceding months that led to the collapse of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was seven and lived in my own universe, but I was sort of aware that the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was seeing its last days. Karl Proper_Noun must have been doing somersaults in his grave.I don\'t remember much about living under communism - except that daily life was "by the book" - but Proper_Noun talked plenty about it to my parents and grandparents. When Proper_Noun went six feet under, it became a bit more tolerable, but it remained totalitarianism nonetheless. Proper_Noun did an exceptional job at depicting the essential aspects of that kind of state, more precisely Proper_Noun regime. The detail that he told is fascinating; as if Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun had let him in on the juicy stuff. Some of it he exaggerated, some he understated, but fundamentally he was accurate. Also, it is imperative that the reader keeps in mind that it was published in 1949. A vast majority of people in Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun were isolated from this kind of knowledge - the government made sure of that through an intricate system of secret police - so this book was a revelation. Of course we now know that, aside from the fictitious names, he essentially portrayed reality. The indoctrination that is described in the book still lingered when I attended school in Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun propaganda machine was thorough indeed.The history of totalitarian states is complex and enormous amount of time and literature has been dedicated to it. This book, however, is a good substitute if one cannot wrestle with a lengthy 700-page tome. It won\'t make you a political scholar, but it\'ll educate you on what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was. It\'s written in a lucid manner; however, one has to read it as nonfiction to truly appreciate the author\'s vision. George Proper_Noun is a genius and his "1984" will be read for a long time.
