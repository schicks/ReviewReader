2I am on a kick of re-reading books that changed the way I see the Proper_Noun when I was younger, books like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and 1984 -- they\'re all pretty heavy-handed. To be sure, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the worst if for no other reason than it is painfully long. But all make a sort of attempt to build a plot and sooner or later digress into some sort of manifesto. In the case of 1984, the main character finds a banned book from the leader of the resistance and several chapters of the real book are from the fictional book.One thing I do recall from learning to write in high school and college is: show, don\'t tell. All of these books, in particular 1984 are pretty thin using the fiction and plot as a thin veneer over their views. In each case, they fall into long monologs or sections that suggest the author is bored of trying to present their dystopian worlds as a canvas. I would have gotten a Proper_Noun at best for any of these had I turned them in.What\'s interesting to me why these books are so different now. In the case of 1984, I read it when that year was still in the future and it wasn\'t quite so dated. But I was also 16 and perhaps not as critical a reader as I am now. Or perhaps the end of the cold war and all that has happened since has just changed the way the Proper_Noun is. Or maybe in my youth or ignorance I was more tolerant of these black-and-white views of the world.So in a way, it\'s worth re-reading as a way of reflection on ones past. Perhaps I won\'t be as disappointed as I delve back into the three books that made me appreciate literature: The Proper_Noun Also Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and The Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun
