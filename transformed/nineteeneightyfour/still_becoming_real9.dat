1It amazes me how such hard hitting topics that touch and can affect everyone can be discussed in such raw detail from a hypothetical scenario presented in the past and can still be so relevant. We have been very fortunate as to avoid such a scenario here in Proper_Noun but the risk of this becoming reality is even more pressing now than ever before. This book could open up many topics for discussion, but the more important matter is what are you doing about it? So what are YOU going to do about it?
