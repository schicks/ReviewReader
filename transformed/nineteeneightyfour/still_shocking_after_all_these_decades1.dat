2I read this book 30 years ago, and I couldn\'t believe a Proper_Noun in total control of people\'s memories and opinions. It seemed like a very distant and utopian future then...Now I read this book again, and the plot is very - frightening - close to reality. Many of the mind-washing methods are in use today, like campaing promisses and even presidential speeches about "soaring economy", "record-breaking production", and even Proper_Noun sacrifice in our well-beign for a brighter future"...Note: 50 years ago, there was no Proper_Noun Just picture what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun could have written then about our present...
