771Eric Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was an important Proper_Noun writer that you probably already know by the pseudonym of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun He wrote quite a few books, but many believe that his more influential ones were "Animal farm" (1944) and "1984" Proper_Noun those two books he conveyed, metaphorically and not always obviously, what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun meant to him.I would like to make some comments about the second book, Proper_Noun That book was written near his death, when he was suffering from tuberculosis, what might have had a lot to do with the gloominess that is one of the essential characteristics of Proper_Noun The story is set in Proper_Noun in a nightmarish 1984 that for Proper_Noun might well have been a possibility, writting as he was many years before that date. Or maybe, he was just trying to warn his contemporaries of the dangers of not opposing the Proper_Noun threat, a threat that involved a new way of life that was in conflict with all that the Proper_Noun held dear.Orwell tried to depict a totalitarian state, where the Proper_Noun didn\'t exist as such, but was merely what the "Big Proper_Noun said it was. Freedom was only total obedience to the Proper_Noun and love an alien concept, unless it was love for the Proper_Noun The story is told from the point of view of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a functionary of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun whose work involved the "correction" of all records each time the "Big Proper_Noun decided that the Proper_Noun had changed. The Proper_Noun slogan said that Proper_Noun controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past", and they applied it constantly by "bringing up to date" the past so as to make it coincide with whatever the Proper_Noun wanted.From Proper_Noun Proper_Noun point of view, many things that scare us are normal. For example, the omnipresence of the "Big Proper_Noun always watching you, and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that punishes treacherous thoughts against the Proper_Noun The reader feels the inevitability of doom that pervades the book many times, in phrases like "Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you".Little by little, Proper_Noun begins to realize that things are not right, and that they should change. We accompany him in his attempt at subversion, and are unwilling witnesses of what that attempt brings about. This book is marked by hopelessness, but at the same time it is the kind of distressing book we all Proper_Noun to read...Why do we Proper_Noun to read "1984"?. In my opinion, basically for two reasons. To start with, Proper_Noun made in this book many observations that are no more merely fiction, but already things that manage to reduce our freedom. Secondly, and closelly linked to my first reason, this is a book that only gets better with the passing of time, as you can read in it more and more implications. One of Proper_Noun main reasons for writting this "negative utopia" might have been to warn his readers against communism, but many years after his death and the fall of communism, we can also interpret it as a caution against the excessive power of mass media, or the immoderate power of any government (even those who don\'t defend communism).Technological innovation should be at the service of men, and allow them to live better lives, but it can be used against them. I guess that is one of Proper_Noun lessons, probably the most important one. All in all, I think you can benefit from reading this book. Because of that, I highly recommend it to you :)Belen Proper_Noun
