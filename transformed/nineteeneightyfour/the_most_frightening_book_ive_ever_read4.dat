19This book vividly portrays the most extreme end of socialism\'s slippery slope. The book is terrifying to read because the eery science fiction-like society which Proper_Noun describes is not so inconceivable. I lived in Proper_Noun a few years ago and was struck by the cold impersonal drabness of everything. In the blank, hollow, empty eyes of many of Proper_Noun elderly I saw how tyranny had literally erased personality. The spark of humanity which puts light in the eyes had been doused, and all that was left was a shell of a human being who was no longer a person, but merely a function with no independent thought. George Proper_Noun 1984 has existed to a large degree in totalitarian regimes of the past, and its radical egalitarian roots exist in society today. They seem to be an integral part of human nature\'s dark side.Two things in this book were especially profound for me. First was Proper_Noun exposition of the social conflicts between the highs, the middles, and the lows, which Proper_Noun Proper_Noun read about in Proper_Noun book. George Proper_Noun understood totalitarianism well enough to see that equality is not socialism\'s end, but merely the propagandistic means for replacing the highs. Self-serving tyrants inevitably usurp socialism\'s ideals and use them to become the highs themselves, indulging themselves in privilege at the expense of the rest of society. After reading Proper_Noun book, Proper_Noun understood the how, and Proper_Noun explained to him the why when he declared, chillingly, that power was an end in and of itself.The second thing which struck me as profound was Proper_Noun exposition of Proper_Noun the official language of Proper_Noun which robbed people of their ability to think by robbing them of their ability to express thoughts in words. Rudimentary examples of doublethink, crimethink, and the thought police can be seen in various political groups within our society today.This book is brilliant and prophetic, a must read for all those socialist utopians who have forgotten the dark realities of human nature.
