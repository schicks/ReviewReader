1I originally read this book back in high school and actually finished it within a day. The story keeps you engaged as well as having a good plot. George Proper_Noun describes the characters very well as well as details of other things within the story such as the structure of the totalitarian party as well as other characters. At points, I swear I could feel what the main character Proper_Noun was going through. Even though I will not spoil the story, I will tell you that this is not a "happy story" with a kind of "hero saves the day" ending. This book brings up what was believed to be a genuine concern from the past in a very descriptive, yet depressing way. I don\'t know how Proper_Noun pulled this off, but this turned out to be a very good book that kept me engaged the entire time.Also, if you do happen to run across the movie, I would definitely recommend watching it. The movie is becoming exceedingly rare, however shouldn\'t be too hard to track down. It is spot-on with the book and gives you more of a visualization of the story. I would recommend!
