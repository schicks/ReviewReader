4The title draws you in, but in the end, it really doesn\'t matter. Did you know that Proper_Noun was going to name the book 1948? In the end, he named it 1984 Proper_Noun play on numbers perhaps?). The title is just that, a title, but how you feel about the government and life will never be the same after reading this book. And how you feel about being in your own home next to a television will never be the same either.I read this a few months ago and you know those books that you want to throw across the room when you are done, the ones that have penetrated into your heart and cut it to shreds? This is such a book. Many say it\'s recommended reading, well I guess it is, but it\'s also a book you NEED to read so you can add it to the short list of those that remain with you always.Oh, the sadness is creeping up. I won\'t give away the ending, but let\'s just say that you will feel outrage and a terrible sort of emptiness. Let it sink in and know that this book touches on what is real, not just some sort of imagined nightmare. Take care and think happy thoughts.
