2Along with\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Animal-Farm/dp/B004G8P0UW">Animal Proper_Noun 1984 is probably Proper_Noun Proper_Noun best known work (although his essays deserve a wide readership and in my view represent some of his best writing) and, both being satires of totalitarianism, said much about the state of the world and intellectual climate of the 1940\'s. If the testimony of readers subject to totalitarian regimes (in particular Proper_Noun Proper_Noun communist regimes) is any guide, 1984 does a superlative job of illustrating the mental atmosphere of daily life in such a state. Perhaps a far greater insight, however, is Proper_Noun description of an Proper_Noun Proper_Noun that is obsessed by enforcing orthodoxy in not only word and deed, but thought - to the extent that the individuals\' ability for critical, independent thought (even if never openly expressed) is extinguished. Not only is this the tendency of most modern-day despotism Proper_Noun theological, ideological or an even less sophisticated ethnic/racial nationalism), but the tendency to declare unpalatable opinions \'thoughtcrime\' is one that even those of us with more benign worldviews must be on guard against.In itself, the story of Proper_Noun isn\'t particularly remarkable, but the oppressive atmosphere it creates together with the warning it provides for modern day readers who may occasionally fail to recognise just how important freedom of thought really is makes it absolutely invaluable in understanding the history and politics of the last hundred years. Recommended in the strongest possible terms.
