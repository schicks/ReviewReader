30Reading it in high school didn\'t have the impact it was supposed to. Like most classics they aren\'t appreciated until later in life. For me 1984 came in 1994.This classic is about government interference in our lives. It is a jab at the soviet system then, under Proper_Noun It was easy to draw parallels between the ever-increasing politically correct language and the language that kept evolving in Proper_Noun New words like Proper_Noun instead of history seemed absurd. I too felt that government and society were encroaching on my privacy and freedom of speech gradually.The irony is that "1984" does not have to be about the political left; it can also be about the political right. Our present government is spying on us in violation of the law. People who challenge our government are called traitors. New phrases of "flip-flop," and "cut and run" are used by politicians to increase social and political pressure. These are new words and phrases that keep evolving just like the language evolves in Proper_Noun Our government repeatedly makes statements to keep its citizens in a state of fear. Americans can now be locked up as enemy combatants without due process.This is what makes this book such a classic and so timeless. The ink, paper and pen are replaced by the keyboard. The screen is replaced by the one you\'re are looking at right now.Are we going to end up like Proper_Noun and be tortured? May I have some victory gin please?
