Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political Proper_Noun maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in Proper_Noun in 1984, follows one man (named Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun whose leader Proper_Noun dictator) is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun political orthodoxy rules the giant country of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which Proper_Noun is located).At the heart of this party\'s political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of "Newspeak" which utilizes what is called "doublethink."Newspeak is the official language of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Proper_Noun states that there is no good and bad but only good and "ungood." Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in one\'s mind and believe in them both. The three Proper_Noun slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 2 Proper_Noun 5).The Proper_Noun keeps everybody in line through Proper_Noun and doublethink. But they also have other methods.

He makes them pay for their "crimes."This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it\'s impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Proper_Noun Here he explains various aspects of Proper_Noun and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Proper_Noun will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)This novel is in a word fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.Finally, after reading this book, I recommend watching the 1984 movie "1984" starring Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun last movie role).In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Proper_Noun world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters; 325 pages)+++++
