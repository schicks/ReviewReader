5Not for the faint of heart, this book grips you and won\'t let go. Although written in the 40s (?), Orwell\'s message of the horrors of what might happen under a socialist government has not staled through the years. I had always heard the phrase Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is watching you", but never understood all that those simple words entailed until I cracked this one open for a read. What I found was an experience very hard to forget. The description of Proper_Noun world is surprisingly vivid, and one can almost feel the Proper_Noun silently watching your every move. The torture scenes and mind games the Proper_Noun brings along about a third of the way in are nothing if not chilling. And then there\'s the abrupt and haunting ending... I\'m not ashamed to say that when I finished I hurled this book across the room in anger, much to the surprise of my family. A classic that I hope will stay on reading lists for years to come, this book should be required reading for all those who considered themselves "educated". Pick it up. You won\'t regret it.
