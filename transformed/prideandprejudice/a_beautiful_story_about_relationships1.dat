62I definitely recommend this book to first time Proper_Noun Proper_Noun readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were "forced" to read this in High Proper_Noun for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can\'t see how anyone can dislike this classic. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun character "Emma" has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Proper_Noun truly has to be my favorite Proper_Noun work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Proper_Noun Proper_Noun existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know Proper_Noun make my kids read it some day. It is superb!
