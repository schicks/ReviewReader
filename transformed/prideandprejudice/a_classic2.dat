18Pride and Proper_Noun is one of the most-beloved novels by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Words cannot do it justice, but Proper_Noun try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife," we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I\'ve read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what\'s going to happen.Here Proper_Noun Proper_Noun uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun From the modest Proper_Noun family, with its five daughters, to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Proper_Noun saw it.There\'s also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Proper_Noun as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Proper_Noun certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart.
