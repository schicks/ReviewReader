9Jane Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a good read. I consider Proper_Noun a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make Proper_Noun a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Proper_Noun books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial Proper_Noun deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Proper_Noun has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Proper_Noun - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Proper_Noun character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one\'s library. I would suggest Proper_Noun above any other Proper_Noun Proper_Noun classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all.
