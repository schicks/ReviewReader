50Of all of the books by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can\'t sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are far better reading.
