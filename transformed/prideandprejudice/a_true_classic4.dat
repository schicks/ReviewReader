7Pride and Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won\'t reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven\'t read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Proper_Noun are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but none are remotely as substantial as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun novel is almost certainly the one where Proper_Noun best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Proper_Noun dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time.

Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character\'s behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can\'t find any serious fault with it. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Proper_Noun fans and newcomers alike.
