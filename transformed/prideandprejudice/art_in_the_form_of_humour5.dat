7Jane Proper_Noun novels have a recurring theme of love and marriage and forever invoke the absurdly beautiful art of humour and irony to fabricate a mesh of interwoven ideas tied by that central idea. Detractors of this late 17th. century and early 18th. century novelist have repeatedly pointed at her unimaginative superficiality and her meek satisfaction to restrain her works on the fringes of the social chaos. Indeed Proper_Noun never ventures deep into the society\'s demeanours but it\'s this contraint of her to resolve to poke fun at the society and the people who live in it by employing the canny and subtle instrument of satire sharpened by sly humour that makes Proper_Noun such a popular and hugely succesful novelist as she is. Nowhere is this attribute so vehemently explicit as in Proper_Noun and Prejudice",regarded by many as the most accomplished work in English literature for its fairy-tale gratifications as well as for its replete involvement of humour.Jane Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun revolves around,as the title itself sugests,the pride of a person and the prejudice of another,both so bizzarely related and paradoxically driving these two persons away from each other. But the Proper_Noun impressions" that the general reader gets is only a figment of the authoress\'s array of ideas conjugated into a rare commodity of literature that both thrills and provokes broodings,and beyond it everything must remain a surprise. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are the principle characters of the novel and it\'s the pride of the latter that actually raiss the prejudice of the former that lents the story an excuse to stretch on as long as it does. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is the tale of the gradual stripping down of the prejudice simulataneous with the quiescent passing away of the pride in a quid pro quo style.The Bennets are a family of seven unique members living in the Proper_Noun village of Proper_Noun and from the very inception it\'s clear that the book is going to be a light read and a hilarious one at that. Mrs.Bennet,"a woman of mean understandind,little information,and uncertain temper" whose "buisness of life was to get her daughters married" is a constant source of laughter in the book,her husband Proper_Noun odd a mixture of quick parts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice",is a man deliberately detached from the fetters of responsibility that marriage and fatherhood unfailingly brings and their five daughters are all so invariably different. The eldest,Jane,is a beautiful,placid,unassuming,innocent and believe-good-in-everything girl,Elizabeth is beautiful too and with a certain charm of intelligence and elegance of wit,Lydia and Proper_Noun both are consumed in their false notions of love and marriage and Proper_Noun is a book-worm possessing the slightest touch of a philosopher. The story begins when a rich bachelor,a wanteed catch in the authoress\'s era,Mr.Charles Bingley rents a house near Proper_Noun Mrs.bennet is despearate to get one of her daughters married to him and part of her wish does come true indeed when Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun fall in love with each other. But the fairy-tale symphony stops abruptly here and under the influence of his sisters and friend Proper_Noun man who likes to maintain an air of pride and aristrocracy about him and draws a line between him and others---Mr.Bingley returns to Proper_Noun Of course there\'s the whisper of a tagedy in this sequence which is easily subdued in the vociferous humourous actions of Proper_Noun whom the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun estate is entailed. It\'s his arrival which brings forth the nature of most of the characters. Mrs.Bennet gets a scope to exhibit her want of intelligence,Mr.Bennet is openly satiric and mocking,Elizabeth is cynical though not without reason and Proper_Noun is at her inocent best. Mr.Collins proposes Proper_Noun rejected and goes on to marry Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun neighbour Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This is one marriage that occurs without even an iota of harmony or intelligence but has all elements of illusory marriage done in haste and without forbrooding.There\'s a furthur twist in the tale as Proper_Noun conveys Proper_Noun his love for her much against his "better judgement" and gets rejected. Inevitably. And from this conjuction onwards,the principle theme of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun gets its proper shape and dimension. One by one the pieces of rags of prejudice war off Proper_Noun and she realises the true character of Proper_Noun who elopes with Proper_Noun and comprehends the man of noble character in Proper_Noun undrneath the layer of abstract ego. Simulataneously Proper_Noun rejects the scepticism his gentryclass has cursed him with and emerges from being "the most disagreeable man in the world" to a man with "no improper pride". The metamorphoses in both Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are not sudden or abrupt but gradual yet stunning and reveal the genius of the script-writer to compose a novel of characters in an overtone of irony and delicate humour.In all there\'re four marriages accomplished in the book and all are vastly different. So a happy-ever-after ending? Yes,but at the same time not without patches of apprehension. In a fine symmetrical plot lacking a concrete stucture and a specific ambition with no specific slots of a \'hero\' as such,Jane Proper_Noun has managed to portary a variety of characters segmented into different natures. The opening sentence of te novel("It is a truth univerally acknowledge,that a single man in possession of a good fortune,must be in want of a wife".) is an ironical statement---perhaps the sharpest in the book---that has descended down the ages to be renowned as one of the better opening lines of any novel. This irony is come to realised in the first chapter itself as we discern that it\'s not the man who runs after the woman but just the opposite. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is scattered wit several other ironies that provide food for the subsistence of the plot. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun also hints at the grotesque pride and egomania sustained by the gentry folk and at the same instant doesn\'t leave the intellectually deprived petty mentality and confined ambitions of the commonfolk out of her domain of satire. In a world of two differebt parts,Elizabeth and Proper_Noun are the sole strings that hold them together. The regal coupling of narration and dialogue exalt the quality of the novel even higher,though being marked mainly from the perspective of Proper_Noun in spite of invoking an omniscient narrator the storyline does lose some gloss. But even so,in a world of imperfection and preposterous false ideas and beliefs,Jane Proper_Noun this remarkable work of literature hints at the chimera of a fairytale translating itself into reality,or be it a hollow reality. All the characters are superbly drawn and in them as wel as in the sequence of all those marvellous events,the reader would decipher his own self and actions from his own life and surroundings. And for that he must be grateful to a writer of excellent wit and humour.
