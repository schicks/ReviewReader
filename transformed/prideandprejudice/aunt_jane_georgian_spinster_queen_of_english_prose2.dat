49I\'m reading Proper_Noun again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought Proper_Noun try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Proper_Noun spirituality, and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week Proper_Noun been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now Proper_Noun hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Proper_Noun I just can\'t get enough. The last two nights Proper_Noun gone to bed reading ahead of where Proper_Noun listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, Proper_Noun still taken by it, hook line Proper_Noun sinker. Jane\'s reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun equating her with the likes of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Proper_Noun describe the Proper_Noun or Last Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or something like the children\'s book Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to my niece.It\'s an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don\'t you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was being blown apart by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has a mobilized Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and an active Proper_Noun (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines\' social positions (Lt. Wickham Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Proper_Noun Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Proper_Noun Elton will propose to Proper_Noun Or if Proper_Noun Knightly and Proper_Noun Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Proper_Noun Frank Proper_Noun come, and what is he like? Has Proper_Noun truly foiled Proper_Noun Martin\'s advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don\'t let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Proper_Noun wrote, and prepare to be enchanted.
