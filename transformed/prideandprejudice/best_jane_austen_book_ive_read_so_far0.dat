14I\'ve read Sense and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and most recently Proper_Noun and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Proper_Noun who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Proper_Noun who lives with her father Proper_Noun Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun up with Proper_Noun Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Proper_Noun Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister\'s Proper_Noun husband Proper_Noun John Proper_Noun warns her about meddling, but she doesn\'t take him seriously. Soon Proper_Noun befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is in love with a farmer named Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but Proper_Noun thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Proper_Noun Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Proper_Noun to set her sights on him. Proper_Noun actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Proper_Noun Elton turns out to be in love with Proper_Noun instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Proper_Noun Weston\'s son Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Proper_Noun who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who is the niece of the rather irritating Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has also come. Proper_Noun is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun had been speculating about her, because Proper_Noun thought she was secretly in love with her friend\'s husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Proper_Noun said he agreed. Proper_Noun is jealous of Proper_Noun anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Proper_Noun but whenever she says anything against her to Proper_Noun Knightly, he defends her. Proper_Noun Weston tells Proper_Noun that she thinks Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is in love with Proper_Noun which horrifies Proper_Noun because if Proper_Noun marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Proper_Noun Proper_Noun returns and Proper_Noun thinks that Proper_Noun is now in love with him. Proper_Noun does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Proper_Noun knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Proper_Noun encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Proper_Noun Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don\'t want to say too much more because I don\'t want to spoil the story if you don\'t know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it\'s a great book and if you are only going to read one Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel, this is the one to pick.
