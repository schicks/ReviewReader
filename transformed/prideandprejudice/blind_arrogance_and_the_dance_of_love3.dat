93Like all of her novels, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, "flawed."The nature of Proper_Noun flaw is essentially Proper_Noun observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Proper_Noun is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Proper_Noun comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Proper_Noun herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Proper_Noun fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Proper_Noun is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow Proper_Noun with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Proper_Noun fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Proper_Noun
