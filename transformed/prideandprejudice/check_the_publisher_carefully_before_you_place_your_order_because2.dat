A few quotes from the publishers website will explain more:"We created your book using Proper_Noun software that includes an automated spell check. Our Proper_Noun software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents Proper_Noun longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our Proper_Noun only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....Our Proper_Noun software can\'t distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our Proper_Noun only sell a couple of copies....We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book.

"So what you\'re getting if you buy the version published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a scanned in, unedited, low quality (and with an almost unreadable font from the sounds of it) unindexed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun table of contents book at a higher price than many of the good quality imprints available. Basically, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is flooding Proper_Noun with these low quality prints (450,000 of them are listed now) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with better quality imprints associated with them. The product description is insufficient for the buyer that\'s not aware of this publisher.Totally unethical marketing.A reader,Scott Proper_Noun has commented: "What you have given us is feedback - not a review. There is an appropriate forum for your complaints. You should delete it as it brings down the average score of a classic." In response, I have to say that Proper_Noun does not provide a forum for complaints and has been remarkably resistant to taking on board criticism from many customers over the Proper_Noun published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In addition, Proper_Noun is the Printer of these Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and makes a substantial cut from them. Sadly, given that the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun version is lumped in with other imprints from genuine publishers, there is Proper_Noun real way of making potential buyers aware of the problems with this particular version of the book without inflicting it on all the other versions available. C\'est la vie.Scott - apologies for replying like this but Proper_Noun removed my ability to comment some time ago - I broke ze commenting guidelines. Re "Amazon does provide a feedback section. You will find it under Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - yes, they do indeed but the response to myself and many others has been uniformly that it\'s not their problem. Look up the discussion forum on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a very enlightening backgrounder on this one. That said, if you bought a book from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and saw what it was like, you\'d be highly annoyed - as most buyers have been - and even if you returned it to Proper_Noun for a refund, you\'d be out of pocket for the postage.
