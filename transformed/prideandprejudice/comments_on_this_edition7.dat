10This edition has a nice binding and the illustrations are charming. However, the margins and type are both too large and the result is a 476 page book which is awkward to hold. The preface by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is one of my least favorite of any Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun edition I have read. Overall, Proper_Noun glad to own this copy, but I often read my Penguin Classics paperback copy instead.
