14I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Proper_Noun books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and have seen the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun movies. I have yet to see Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but I am looking forward to it. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun main character, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Proper_Noun is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Proper_Noun is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Proper_Noun is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun who is followed by exasperating Proper_Noun Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Proper_Noun like the Proper_Noun She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers\' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Proper_Noun Charles Proper_Noun who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Proper_Noun His friend, Proper_Noun Fitzwilliam Proper_Noun his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Proper_Noun Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood. "It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Proper_Noun meets both Proper_Noun Bingley and Proper_Noun Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn\'t. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Proper_Noun Darcy wrong?
