4If I were reviewing Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun alone, I would give this novel six stars. It is rightfully listed on every top 100 literature list. I am currently reading it for the sixth time and still finding wonderful new things in the story. For those who have only seen the movie versions, you are in for a treat... no movie can do this story justice.My complaint is that the Proper_Noun version I purchased was advertised as illustrated, but there are very few illustrations and the quality is poor, and there is no way to zoom in to see the illustrations better (as you can do with text on the Proper_Noun This is a past-copyright book and it is available free from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and used to be free on Proper_Noun I paid 99 cents to get the illustrated version, and it really wasn\'t worth it. Seriously.
