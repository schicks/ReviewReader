13I ordered three novels by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a class. It was my misfortune that all three were published by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun All three are unacceptable. Pride and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun have no page numbers, chapters start in the middle of the page, and the books are physically too large to hold comfortably. Sense and Proper_Noun is physically smaller, but the type is so small as to be unreadable, and pages from a completely unrelated book are bound in the middle. Look for copies of these novels from another publisher.
