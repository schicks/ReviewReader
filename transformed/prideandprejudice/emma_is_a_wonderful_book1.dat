13"Emma" was the first Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book I read, and after reading all of Proper_Noun novels, it is still my favorite. The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn\'t put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Proper_Noun which was based on Proper_Noun Clueless was made in the 1990\'s, while Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was born in the late 1700\'s and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that "Emma" came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during Proper_Noun class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!
