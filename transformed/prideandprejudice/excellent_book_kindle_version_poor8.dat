164It goes without saying Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun is a classic of all time. My concern here and the reason for the low rating is the poor quality of this Proper_Noun version. There are typos and in several places in the text very, very simple errors are made: in a few places, the same word repeats itself along the lines of Proper_Noun the chair," a couple malapropisms I am positive were not in the original text, and other typesetter\'s error that, if this Proper_Noun edition had been subject to even a cursory review by a proofreader, would have been caught. I too would like to mention the Proper_Noun that emphasized Proper_Noun are all Proper_Noun in this version as Proper_Noun annoying. I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is.
