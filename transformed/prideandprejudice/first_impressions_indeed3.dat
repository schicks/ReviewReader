9Let me tell you about my first impression of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as "polite" society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the Proper_Noun society" Proper_Noun dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Proper_Noun as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Proper_Noun is fortuitous that Proper_Noun retitled her book because First Proper_Noun does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun as a title, connotes. In Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Proper_Noun is arrogant and Proper_Noun is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Proper_Noun has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics.
