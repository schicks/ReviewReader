11great book of course for any jane austin fan. this review is more for this kindle edition. i decided to buy the one dollar version after a few chapters because i do not like the repetitive use of dialog in all caps. it makes me imagine too much yelling. granted i do not know whether miss austin wrote it that way or the scribes of this digital book did. i just know i do not like it. if you are like me or unsure just get the sample first.
