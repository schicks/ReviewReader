16My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and Proper_Noun it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun time in Proper_Noun it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. Proper_Noun can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read Proper_Noun once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn\'t understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don\'t understand it, and then come back and literally Proper_Noun on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels now.
