8I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was so exasperated by Proper_Noun herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn\'t get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Proper_Noun the entire time by Proper_Noun - Emma\'s words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Proper_Noun prose. It is Proper_Noun who is too snooty to go to the Proper_Noun party, for instance, and Proper_Noun who is mocked by Proper_Noun both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn\'t go. Proper_Noun doesn\'t say it, she merely reports Proper_Noun and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn\'t like it, try it again.
