15Okay, I admit it: I read Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun in high school and didn\'t like it. However, age and the wisdom that comes with it helped me to realize that my dislike of the book probably had more to do with my dislike of my then-teacher, who had the ability to make even the greatest literary masterpiece seem dry and dull. In recent years, Proper_Noun read most of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun other novels and have enjoyed them immensely, and so I have finally worked my way back to Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun story is familiar to most: it centers around the five young Proper_Noun sisters, who range in age from their mid-teens to early twenties, making them quite ripe for marriage (at least according to their mother). And then there are the men, for as the novel\'s opening line notes: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." Such a man, Proper_Noun Bingley, buys a house close to the Proper_Noun family, and initially, he seems fated to marry the oldest, loveliest Proper_Noun girl, Proper_Noun Bingley is accompanied by his haughty friend, Proper_Noun Darcy, who, while possessing an even greater fortune, quickly earns the dislike of all those he meets, particularly Proper_Noun the strong-minded second Proper_Noun daughter. And from the Proper_Noun held by each of the four principle characters described above Proper_Noun namely Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun derives her prejudice.In many ways, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun reads like a modern-day romantic comedy, complete with misunderstandings and mishaps. Similarly, the embarrassment which Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun suffer at the hands of their mother and younger sisters would make them perfect candidates for today\'s reality Proper_Noun But of course, Proper_Noun writing contains a level of wit and subtlety rarely found in any contemporary form of entertainment, making this novel is a true classic-a rare gem that still shines brightly to this day.
