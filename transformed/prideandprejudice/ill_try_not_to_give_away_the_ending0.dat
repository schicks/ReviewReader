14Emma is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Proper_Noun in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century Proper_Noun plot centres around Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen\'s characterisation is delightful: characters such as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Proper_Noun characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Proper_Noun herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen\'s dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Proper_Noun is a tremendously satisfying read.
