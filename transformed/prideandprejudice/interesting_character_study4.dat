133Emma Proper_Noun is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been "Emma knows best". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Proper_Noun misadventures as she tries to marry Proper_Noun off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn\'t always know best.This is, I think, one of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun less popular works, perhaps because there isn\'t a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn\'t care for the book or for Proper_Noun self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The wit is sharp as usual Proper_Noun maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read.
