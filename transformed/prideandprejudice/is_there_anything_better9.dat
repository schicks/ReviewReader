6In college, Proper_Noun as supposed to read this book. But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring. Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun always has me curled up in a chair while it\'s snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: "Guns and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn\'t really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Proper_Noun Proper_Noun after all, and I wasn\'t sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it\'s fun, it\'s hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun deBourgh and Proper_Noun not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the Proper_Noun yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun This is by far my favorite Proper_Noun novel of the bunch Proper_Noun Proper_Noun coming in a close second). So, this winter, wait for a snowy day Proper_Noun choose any day, you can\'t have a bad Proper_Noun day) and get ready to be taken away. And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you\'ll be surprised how much you may enjoy it.
