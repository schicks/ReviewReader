399It doesn\'t get better than Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Whether you\'re the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you\'re going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun at my mother\'s recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother\'s taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn\'t displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I love the Proper_Noun vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun should be together but their Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; Proper_Noun simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won\'t be too long before I pick it up again. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf.
