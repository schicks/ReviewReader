14"Pride and Proper_Noun is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it\'s had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Proper_Noun Proper_Noun grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it\'s rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Proper_Noun family is in an uproar when wealthy Proper_Noun Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Proper_Noun daughter Proper_Noun -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls.

Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Proper_Noun and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it\'s rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Proper_Noun brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other.
