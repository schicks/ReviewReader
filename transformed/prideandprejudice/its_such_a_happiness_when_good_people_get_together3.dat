7"Emma Proper_Noun handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition" is a suitable heroine for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lightest, frothiest novel. While "Emma" is not nearly as dramatic as Proper_Noun other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others\' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Proper_Noun a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the "natural daughter of somebody." Proper_Noun becomes determined to pair Proper_Noun with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer\'s proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Proper_Noun Elton. When Proper_Noun latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone Proper_Noun of love is a lot harder than getting them Proper_Noun it.At around the same time, two people that Proper_Noun has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the reserved, remote Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun with rumors of a married man\'s interest in her). Proper_Noun begins a flirtatious friendship with Proper_Noun but for some reason is unable to get close to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people\'s romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books, "Emma" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren\'t any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There\'s just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Proper_Noun wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There\'s some moments of seriousness (such as Proper_Noun rudeness to kind, silly Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but it\'s also laced with some entertaining dialogue ("Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way") and barbed humor Proper_Noun ridiculous and obnoxious Proper_Noun Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Proper_Noun falling for a guy who\'s known her literally all her life, but Proper_Noun makes the subtle relationship between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments ("If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she\'s young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there\'s a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Proper_Noun neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Proper_Noun the fluttery Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and even the smarmy Proper_Noun Elton and his bulldozing wife."Emma" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight.
