12I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is Proper_Noun it happens and in this Proper_Noun is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Proper_Noun family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are the two eldest daughters and Proper_Noun forms an attachment early on to Proper_Noun a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Proper_Noun Darcy interferes in Proper_Noun attachment to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Proper_Noun Wickham, Proper_Noun Darcy\'s father\'s godchild. As fate would have it, Proper_Noun Darcy develops an attachment to Proper_Noun and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don\'t know if the title is to reflect the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Darcy and the prejudice of Proper_Noun against him. At one point she says the following: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Proper_Noun relates more to our opinion of ourselves, Proper_Noun to what we would have others think of us." I see her really exploring this in the character of Proper_Noun Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters.
