7This is my favourite book in the world!! This is a story that is full of humour, class conflict, family expectations, dancing, irony and of course, romance.I have read Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun several times and it is still thrilling, waiting to see proud Proper_Noun snub and then fall for the prejudice Proper_Noun who is far from willing to give him a chance. However, they both must realise that things are not always as they appear to be.Lizzy\'s father, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is absolutely hilarious and is so full of sarcasm and irony that he is one of the funniest characters of Proper_Noun books. Mrs Proper_Noun is also very funny as a hypochondriac whose husband spends most of his time in his library to get away from her! Lizzy herself has a great sense of humour and sometimes uses it to tease Proper_Noun I have to agree with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as her favourite character of her books is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a book that can be read time and time again. Once you get used to the language, it becomes easier to read and hard to put down. If you ever get a chance to watch the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series box set, allow yourself lots of time as you will not be able to stop watching it... and it\'s 6 hours long!!This is the best story that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wrote in her lifetime and is still fantastic after 200 years.
