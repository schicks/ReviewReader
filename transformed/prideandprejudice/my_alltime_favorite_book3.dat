14I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring. What a shame that you can\'t relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in Proper_Noun literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the characters will resemble people you know. Yes, the dialogue may be difficult to follow at first but, after a while, "listening" to it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or 12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least twice for school. In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun world. Then try Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun afraid I can\'t recommend Proper_Noun Proper_Noun very highly). If you have any trace of imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read the book before seeing any of the adaptations. Each has its advantages, but the recent Proper_Noun version with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a sight to behold. The Proper_Noun version is also good, but not quite as beautiful to watch. It pains me to say this, but the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun version is far and away the weakest.
