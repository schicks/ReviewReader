9I originally read this for my sophmore English class, and didn\'t enjoy it too much because of all of the analysis we were required to do. I re-read it the following summer and discovered it makes much better leisure reading. Proper_Noun say the ideal audience is obviously female (considering the main character is the fiesty heroine Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of any age.Even though it is a classic, it still manages to be quite a page-turner, with unexpected plot twists and witty dialogue. The most enjoyable aspect of this novel is watching the relationship between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun develop. I\'ve read the book several more times, and each time I find myself anticipating their eventual confession of each others\' feelings for one another. Although the ending of the story is predictable, it is how this ending is reached which makes for an interesting read.The book is largely character and dialogue-based, so Proper_Noun shy away from it if that isn\'t your thing. However, to any classics-lover, this book is a must! Proper_Noun also highly recommend viewing the Proper_Noun mini-series Proper_Noun one featuring Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun to fully experience the Georgian Proper_Noun setting. But, trust me, you won\'t want to simply ditch the book to watch the movie version. Nothing can quite compare to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun original writing.
