9"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife". That\'s how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a gentleman\'s daughter and Proper_Noun Darcy is a gentleman, but Proper_Noun along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Proper_Noun Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Proper_Noun Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Proper_Noun Darcy. Proper_Noun Bingley becomes captivated with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun eldest sister, and Proper_Noun Darcy has an eye for Proper_Noun herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That\'s the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and Proper_Noun been doing that for a few years, and yet, it\'s always fresh when a get around to reading it.
