214Note to all Proper_Noun users - there are some books that are meant to be read on the Proper_Noun and some that must have just been scanned into the computer. This version is in the latter group. It\'s Proper_Noun Sometimes you only get half a screen, other times the text is different sizes. It has no table of contents for navigation. I love the book, I hate the version.
