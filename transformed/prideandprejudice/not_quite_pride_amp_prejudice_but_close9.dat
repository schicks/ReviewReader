24If I could do it over again, I would read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun before I read her Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Proper_Noun combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Proper_Noun starring Proper_Noun Proper_Noun then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Proper_Noun version of Proper_Noun is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Proper_Noun She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman\'s journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone\'s lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Proper_Noun will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf.
