13I adore and revere Proper_Noun and this book is, for me, the pinnacle. It\'s such a masterwork of the Proper_Noun language, so richly layered and textured and such a sharp observation of the society in which Proper_Noun lived. Read only at surface level, it seems little more than a sweet romance but when the text is examined deeply the mastery of Proper_Noun becomes apparent.Was Proper_Noun a feminist? I\'m not entirely convinced of this but what I do know is that she was keenly, keenly aware of the way her world worked. She knew that the only power a woman had was to charm and flirt until she captured herself a rich husband. A woman did not have the power to seek her own occupation and a sharp and educated mind was not exactly appreciated. This is why Proper_Noun and her most bewitching heroine Proper_Noun are so very subversive. Austen\'s creation, like Proper_Noun herself, bucks the convention of the time and is determined to see her life played out on her own terms. She will not settle for anything less than love and though that may seem simple to today\'s reader, it was anything but in an age when money and status meant everything. Proper_Noun is not perfect. She makes mistakes and she is judgmental at times but her greatest strength is her determination to be true to herself.And yet even though Proper_Noun makes such a strong case for independence of spirit, she is also kind to those who bow to convention. Though Proper_Noun dear friend Proper_Noun makes a choice that initially seems extremely repugnant, it is easy to see that, really, Proper_Noun is simply doing what she must to survive. It is not that Proper_Noun is any less true to herself than Proper_Noun it is simply that she is rather more practical and pragmatic. She sees her situation in a very clear light and, in the end, chooses what is for her the lesser of two evils. I think that Proper_Noun respected this as well. Being brave and forging a new path is not for all of us.As for Proper_Noun he is also a product of his time. He behaves in a way that society feels a man should. At a very young age he must deal with gross abuses of his father\'s trust and a rather horrific betrayal of his family\'s kindness. He is forced to shoulder responsibility at a time when his peers may have been busy gambling and chasing skirts. There are few in whom Proper_Noun can confide and he holds his cards so close to his chest that he must shut out others who could perhaps be of assistance to him. Though his wealth and status seem to suggest that he is above the slings and arrows of society, it turns out that this assumption is a naive one. Proper_Noun is no more free to do whatever he likes than Proper_Noun is.What makes this book so satisfying is that the hero and heroine triumph over their adverse circumstances. At heart, Proper_Noun was a romantic. She clearly had hope that the narrow confines of her world could stretch enough to allow for happiness and self-fulfillment. She believed in the power of love to conquer some very daunting obstacles and she believed that love could help people grow into a better version of themselves. I think it is this optimism that makes Proper_Noun so appealing to her readers.
