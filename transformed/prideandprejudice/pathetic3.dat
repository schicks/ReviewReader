39This is a long book and you don\'t want to put up with the terrible formatting, spelling, etc. I uploaded a picture of one page of this book. Take a look.I then purchased Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun (Illustrated Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (Jun 26, 2013) - Proper_Noun eBook" for an extra dollar and everything is as it should be. Wonderful illustrations are a plus too!
