53I have always loved the style and social politics of the Proper_Noun period Proper_Noun time of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun But when I read "Sense and Proper_Noun in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give "Pride and Proper_Noun a try. I did and have since become a complete Proper_Noun I am now able to peruse joyfully through "Sense and Proper_Noun with a new understanding and appreciation of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The reason? "Pride and Proper_Noun is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The characters, and the situations Proper_Noun presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Proper_Noun society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and is essential to every reader\'s library. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters\' appearances. In summary "Pride and Proper_Noun is a great book for beginner Proper_Noun readers and seasoned fans, and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a great Proper_Noun for fully enjoying and understanding the book.
