25I am really enjoying this book. I won\'t comment on it from a literary sense. Everyone has already exhausted that area. However, I will say that the Proper_Noun version is great except that the text does not always translate in the proper fonts. Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Proper_Noun as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Proper_Noun at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Proper_Noun is a joy to read though and it goes very fast.
