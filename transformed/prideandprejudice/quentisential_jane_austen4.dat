9This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Proper_Noun Austens writing. The characters are so vivid and they stay with you. The heroine Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself. Ah and Proper_Noun he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride. The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it\'s a jouney everyone should take. Even if you have seen the great Proper_Noun version or the new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun version, you still should read the book. Proper_Noun Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can\'t match Proper_Noun Austens proes, it\'s such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Proper_Noun after all.
