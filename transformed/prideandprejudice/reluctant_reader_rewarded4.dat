8When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can\'t tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it\'s well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now Proper_Noun who sneered at Proper_Noun at the first, am planning on reading "Sense and Proper_Noun over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!
