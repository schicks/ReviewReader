22I was so happily surprised when I received this book--much nicer than expected! It is small coffee table-sized, is printed on nice, thick paper, and has a lovely mustard cloth cover under the dust jacket. When you open it, the layout of the pages make the book lovely to look at and read. In one column are the annotations: notes about the text, the history of the time, and etc. Throughout the book are illustrations of period art, beautiful to look at. This edition is a wonderful collector\'s piece and you get so much more than the story Proper_Noun would have been happy with just the story and illustrations, too!). Janeites and others, don\'t miss this book.
