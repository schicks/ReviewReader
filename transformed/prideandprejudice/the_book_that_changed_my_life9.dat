10I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Proper_Noun (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was Proper_Noun rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Proper_Noun was my idol. Proper_Noun replaced Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun \'Sleeping Proper_Noun as the man of my dreams. Mrs Proper_Noun nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I love this book and I can\'t even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Proper_Noun Proper_Noun enough. If Proper_Noun haven\'t read it - WHAT Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun If Proper_Noun have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun all over again.
