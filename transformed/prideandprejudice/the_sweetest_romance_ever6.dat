6I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern Proper_Noun I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Proper_Noun family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Proper_Noun family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Proper_Noun Darcy and the exuberant, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are so many good parts to this book! I don\'t quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Proper_Noun is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Proper_Noun Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Proper_Noun Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Proper_Noun Proper_Noun connections".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn\'t wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun her fiesty personality) and Proper_Noun Darcy Proper_Noun and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Proper_Noun and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Proper_Noun Darcy and Proper_Noun I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Princess-Bride/dp/0345348036">The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.
