6Out of all Proper_Noun Proper_Noun heroines, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Proper_Noun is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Proper_Noun has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Proper_Noun she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob.

But this is where readers\' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Proper_Noun at the end of the book as she was at the beginning."Emma" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes.
