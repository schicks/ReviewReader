14Ok. I\'ll admit Proper_Noun read this book many times. If Proper_Noun read the Proper_Noun as many times, Proper_Noun be a theological genius or savant or something. I\'ll also admit I own the complete finished works of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in hardback, though I seldom read her other works anymore. Proper_Noun been out of grad school for 35 years, after all. Furthermore, I will admit I have 3 copies of Proper_Noun on my Proper_Noun One of those copies is AWFUL--riddled with editorial errors attributable to digital input glitches. The other is a bit better, but this version I had to get because it was free and it was illustrated. If you have a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and if you are fairly obsessed with color, as I am, you will enjoy this particular version. Here\'s why:(1)It is written from a publication of the work close to the author\'s original spelling and phrasing--not true of today\'s more modern Proper_Noun versions of the work. Can\'t be having weird spellings and grammar quirks in high school and college Proper_Noun lit classes here. It confuses the students, who already wonder what\'s so great about this British old maid writer from a couple centuries back.(2)It incorporates the illustrations from not one but two different printings of Proper_Noun done after the author was deceased, mind you, but charming and roughly contemporaneous with her period, nonetheless.(3) Because it has two different sets of illustrations, it is fascinating to see the different depictions of the characters. Interesting that the men seem to me to look similar in both sets of illustrations, and some of the minor female characters (who are not prominent in these illustrations) seem to look the same, but the principals are different. Lizzy is dark haired in one set and golden haired in the other. Proper_Noun is golden haired in both. I was startled by this at first, but soon I just found it more amusing than confusing. It doesn\'t take much to amuse me.I got this free through one of the email services which offers free or low cost Proper_Noun e-books. I\'m keeping it and deleting the other two. It\'s cool, especially if you\'re an Proper_Noun fan.
