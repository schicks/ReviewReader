31This is my favorite Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel and I have read it many times. The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried. There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters. I found the reader\'s voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Proper_Noun Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading. The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Bottom line: not up to the standard that Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun deserves.
