10This is a very good copy of the book. The outside is very pretty and very sturdy (definitely not cheapo cardboard). Also, the paper is high quality. Looks like an antique book without the antique fragility.Received much sooner than expected too, in two weeks instead of the month Proper_Noun said it would take.
