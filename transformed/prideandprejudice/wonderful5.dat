16Emma is the first Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel I ever read, and 13 years later it\'s still my favorite. It\'s also the most accessible, easy to read Proper_Noun novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Proper_Noun were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that Proper_Noun met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Proper_Noun views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!
