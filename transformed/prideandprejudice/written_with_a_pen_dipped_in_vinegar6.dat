7My mother used to read me a chapter a night of this book when I was about eight. I didn\'t get it. For reasons lost in the mists of history, I picked it up on my own in my 20s and found, to my delight, that I couldn\'t put it down. Since then, I have bought, read, and reread everything Proper_Noun ever wrote, and was a member of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun back in the early \'80s, loooong before she became so fashionable.What I\'ve learned from my frequent readings of her works is that each time I read them, I get a little more than I did the last time. Her language appears convoluted to us, yes, partly because she wrote with the voice of her time and partly because we are probably like, you know, as inarticulate a people as ever lived. So do we denigrate Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun for their voices?The themes of Proper_Noun works are all similar - they all relate to the difficulties of women finding their own places in a rigidly structured society in which women were defined strictly by the men in their lives. In fact, when I visited her burial place in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was surprised to find a 6-foot marble slab fully engraved with a lengthy narrative about her, until I realized that there was Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun about her writing - she was described and defined strictly in relation to her father and family. So she definitely knew whereof she spoke; in her time, there was no life for a women outside of marriage, and the frantic attempts of parents - and the girls themselves - to marry off their daughters, which appears funny to us in our more enlightened age, is actually painful and somewhat pathetic. (Almost as pathetic as the efforts of many women today to find their own rich, indulgent Proper_Noun Darcys... especially in light of their many other options.)One of the characteristics of Proper_Noun writing that I find most interesting is that while she writes in great detail of the lives of her characters and their immediate surroundings, there is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun about the greater world. I doubt that the Proper_Noun "London" appears in any of them except briefly in "Sense and Proper_Noun they all take place in small villages somewhere in the middle or south of Proper_Noun and rarely wander further than the distance of a post-lunch walk. The novels were written at the end of the Proper_Noun era and the beginning of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun so there was plenty of upheaval, social and otherwise, occuring all over Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun but nary a whisper of it ever rears its ugly head in her works. She holds her magnifying glass very close to her own garden gate; her perspective is entirely microcosmic without being claustrophobic - that\'s part of her genius. She can turn over a rock and document the frantic scurrying underneath it in its own terms, drawing no inferences from the activity under the rest of the tree. Good? Bad? I don\'t know, and I think it doesn\'t matter - but there is probably Proper_Noun a better, more detailed, or more honest picture of time and place in all of Proper_Noun literature.I am torn between being glad that students are exposed to literature, and sorry that the teaching of it is so pedantic that all the humor and magic of great books is buried. I only hope, for those who were force-fed on Proper_Noun and others of her ilk, that they will pick up these works on their own later in life and derive from them the pleasure that is there for the asking. Meanwhile, I strongly recommend periodic infusions of all of Proper_Noun works, of which I believe "Pride and Proper_Noun is the most accessible.
