I can count the poems I know, at least the non-limerick ones, on a single hand. I\'m not a fan of poetry, and I truly see much of it as overblown, a good thing taken to a ridiculously inflated extreme. This book isn\'t poetry, but it\'s also not pure narrative. It\'s somewhere in the gray between, and I enjoyed every single page of it.McCarthy had me on the 14th line when I read "granitic beast." No, I didn\'t have to be told this was a reference to stone. Its use here, early in the work, deliberate, familiar yet uncommon, communicated to me exactly what this book would be about, and more importantly how it would be told, and I couldn\'t wait to ingest it. The contemplated and intentional use of this word in this place told me of texture and color and temperature, and its context told me of fear, uncertainty, cruelty, and the close specter of menace. I was hooked before the first page was done.I enjoyed this book\'s writing style immensely, its story simple and told in a manner that came to me clearly, instantly creating depth with a minimum of prose. Words like "envaccuuming," and phrases like "isocline of death" were absolutely brilliant--I bite Proper_Noun hand melodramatically wishing Proper_Noun written them. This highly evocative austerity was mirrored in the father\'s and the son\'s conversations, in which so little was said, but in which I was seeing absolutely clearly the cant of a head, a look in the eyes, the faintest curl of smile. I was reminded very happily of the magnificent work of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun especially\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/To-the-White-Sea/dp/0385313098">To the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the wonderfully lyrical story unfolded. No, I didn\'t need quotation marks or crucial apostrophes. There was never any question what was happening, who was saying what or where the story was headed. Honestly, do they care about proper punctuation in the wasteland? I didn\'t miss a thing, and the modestly different narrative presentation didn\'t faze me in the least. In fact, it reminded me instantly of e e cummings. Ah, reluctantly back to poetry. Later on when the pair made it to the sea, and the prose touched on Proper_Noun instantly Proper_Noun S. Eliot\'s classic came to mind.I very much enjoyed the father, an object lesson in survival and just what that takes. He not only was educated, but also remembered it and knew how and when to apply it. He was inventive, attentive and observant, and deliberately learned from every experience. He anticipated, adapted and showed the courage to take immediate action, having thought through consequences beforehand. He was no Proper_Noun but from the opening minutes of the crisis he knew what was at hand; his survival, and his son\'s, were due to his seriousness and intelligence and his application of them.This book is not about the end of the world. It\'s not about nuclear winter, man\'s inevitable murder of the planet, the inherent barbarity of man, none of that. This book is about the only thing that matters, a parent\'s love for a child, and what at the absolutely basic level of survival you can and cannot do for those whom you treasure most, what you will go through and what you must decide upon for them to have all they need and deserve. This book is about the rapture and the agony of parenthood. It took me two nights to read this book, and both nights after midnight when I reluctantly put it down, I went upstairs to re-tuck-in Proper_Noun daughter and Proper_Noun son, and to kiss them in their sleep, through the silent tears of adoration this book brought forth.This unpleasantly dark, ominous book reminded me of a few crucial things: Proper_Noun daughter and Proper_Noun son are the most incredible and important things I have ever done or will ever do. Their well-being is never assured, and I can never, ever stop looking out for them and teaching them what I know of their world. One day I will move on, and they must be ready when that happens.Bottom line: This is not a cheery, happy, frothy and light read. It is cold and hard and painful. But there is joy in it. Be ecstatic it is only a story, that tonight you sleep in a bed in a house, with food, water, and your dog on the hearth. Be aware of and happy that you are reading this expertly rendered, magnificently crafted work of highly evocative prose, and look forward to the next one, whatever the subject.
