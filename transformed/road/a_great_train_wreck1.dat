84I have gotten more useless stars on my previous review in just a couple of days than I usually would get over the lifetime of a review, so I decided it must not have been very helpful.So I will just say that:-If you don\'t like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun short stories, particularly the style;-If you are not a fan of apocalyptic fiction, particularly that which focuses more on mood than psychology, setting or science;-If you find the southern Proper_Noun theme library depressing, or if, not being from the American Proper_Noun you just find it hard to get into that level of grotesqueness and sheer despair;-If you read apocalyptic Proper_Noun science fiction for the setting and scientific pondering;you probably will not enjoy this book.On the other hand, it seems that a lot of people really enjoyed it. I personally do not find any redeeming qualities in repeatedly and dully recounting humanity\'s failures. Life\'s a piece of crap and then you die, or maybe not.Books I would recommend in lieu of this:Cormac Proper_Noun short stories, if you want to get an idea of his work. They are shorter so you can break the depressing Southern Proper_Noun and terse style into manageable chunks.Galapagos, by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a modern post-apocalyptic scenario with an absurd but hopeful Proper_Noun unpredictable) ending.A Fine Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for a book on the human spirit in the face of all odds.The Long Proper_Noun for a book about a long walk in the face of physical, psychological, and other obstacles.For Southern Proper_Noun I have no recommendations. I don\'t like it.I know that many people love this book. Keep in mind that although you and I disagree, I am still providing information about the book that can be useful to people who have not yet decided whether to buy it. That is my purpose. I\'m not trying to malign Proper_Noun or your personal taste, but to give a review from a different point of view.
