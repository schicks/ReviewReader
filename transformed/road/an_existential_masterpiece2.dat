8On the surface, Proper_Noun book seems very straightforward - pared down dialogue, straightforward situations, and minimal plot. That\'s because he has far greater ambitions. The reviewers here who complained that the book doesn\'t have a plot, or that Proper_Noun is rehashing old themes, just don\'t get it. Harlequin romances and murder mysteries need good plots. Great literature doesn\'t. Like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun uses old themes and narratives to craft an original interpretation of the human condition.This is far more than just a compelling story. Proper_Noun has written a profound work of literature which rips into the deepest layers of our subconscious hopes and fears. It can be read on many levels, from existential philosophy (revisiting Proper_Noun old question - why don\'t we just kill ourselves?) to religious allegory, from social critique (all of the world\'s money and consumer goods have ultimately become meaningless) to a dark satire of Proper_Noun road literature. The dialogue is very straightforward, but at times the narration soars. Parts of this book are nothing less than poetry, adamantine and pure.This isn\'t a cheerful little page turner to read by the pool. I had terrible nightmares after I read this book. That\'s because it got deep inside me, disturbed me, and challenged me. It isn\'t warm and cuddly, but great books rarely are.
