7I was really moved by this book. Perhaps it is because I am a parent and I can relate to the feelings of unconditional love a father has for his child, or perhaps it is because of the way it was written, or the simple, stark truths that emerge from a tale of survival, but I really loved this book and found it hard to put down.It is a story of a man and his boy traveling through a post-apocalyptic landscape, struggling to survive. There is despair aplenty, horrible images of depravity and destruction, and little hope - if any - for the future. I found it compelling, though. Yes, I kept wondering why they would go on, where they were going, and what possibility there was of finding anything better. But it was the mere possibility that I found hopeful and compelling. Maybe it\'s my optimistic nature. The mere fact that they woke to a new day, that they were alive, still, despite the all the odds against them, kept me rooting for them. This book is clearly not for everyone, as the reviews reflect. Some don\'t get it, or maybe just don\'t want to, and some just don\'t like downer themes - fair enough. I can appreciate not wanting to experience the occasional wrenching emotions in my read, but I also appreciate more than just the story line. I think this book delivers on multiple fronts - style, impact, lyric construction, and emotion - but perhaps it is an acquired taste.The prose is lyric and beautiful, though spare in the extreme. There are some passages that simply glow. I found that the writing, though spare and efficient, was well-crafted; I appreciate writing that allows my imagination to do the work, that conveys texture, emotion, a complete picture of the situation, without being overly florid. I\'ve read criticisms of Proper_Noun lack of punctuation in this book, or reviews that attack his use of style as a crutch. I\'ve also read that the spareness of the style is intended to reflect the bleakness of the book\'s setting. I can\'t say that I noticed one way or another, absorbed as I was in the story. This is a matter of preference, but I found the book extremely readable and would have found it so regardless of style.Other reviewers have taken the book to task because it isn\'t realistic in it\'s portrayal of the post-apocalyptic landscape. It is strange to me to get hung up on whether or not there should be more animals, or whether the roads should be in better shape... that\'s really not the point. To me, this story\'s point was about a man in extremis, protecting his child regardless of anything and for me there really doesn\'t need to be anything more than that. I found the story ultimately triumphant, hopeful, and moving. Sometimes the storytelling is every bit as important as the story, and I feel the book succeeds on both counts.
