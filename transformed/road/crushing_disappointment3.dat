46This is a review of the audio book version. Apparently Proper_Noun lucky I didn\'t actually read the printed version, judging from all the criticisms being targeted at the author\'s choice to forego traditional punctuation marks. The narrator did a fine job I thought, incidentally.So why the 1 star? First, this book has no plot. Nothing of note ever really happens. Even when you think something is about to happen (like when they encounter the cannibals), the author backs off as if too unsure of himself to explore the possibilities.The father and son exhibit little or no ingenuity at dealing with their circumstances. Instead, they are victims of their circumstances and seem to accept their fate even as they travel on. They are never really challenged in any significant way during the story, nor do they challenge themselves. They just plod along, cold and wet and hungry. "Oh woe is me."But the worst offense is that this book has no point! I can enjoy the journey that a tale takes me on, even if I don\'t particularly care for the destination. But this story has neither: the journey is slow, repetitive, and boring, and the ending is so uneventful that I had to rewind the audio book and listen to the ending again because I thought maybe my mind had wandered and Proper_Noun missed some crucial reveal of information.But no, the book just sort of ends. Was there some sort of allegory I was supposed to derive from the story or the cryptic ending? If so it was lost on me. Allow me to quote Proper_Noun Proper_Noun from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun by the way, you know, when you\'re telling these little stories? Here\'s a good idea - have a Proper_Noun It makes it SO much more interesting for the listener!"The most heart-breaking part is that this book won a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun A Proper_Noun Proper_Noun What a sad fact to contemplate that is.
