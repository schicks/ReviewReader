5Most of you know that this book is a dark and cynical view of what happens to people when sources of food, water, law, medicine and shelter are taken away.What many do not know before reading this book is that it\'s largely about the special relationship between father and child, to what ends a father will go to ensure the safety of his child and to what lengths a child will go to in order to please the one he loves - even if that child does not believe in the risk. This book has been described by many as a father/son coming of age book, but I see few changes needed if this was a father/daughter book or if this was a mother/son book. The author could have almost gone with parent/child as the descriptors.What kept putting a lump on my throat, as a parent, was the way the father was constantly forced to lie to his child knowing it would be senselessly cruel and torturous to be frank at all times, and the way that the child actually knew he was being lied to for the purpose of morale, and understood this (even calling the father out often).Many parents can relate to those very difficult questions that children can sometimes ask ... the ones we tend to answer with vague phrases like "maybe" or "I don\'t know" ... and how the child often knows the answer before they ask but simply want to hear the truth from a parent that is reluctant to give it. Now take those questions, usually about more trivial issues like the death of a pet or whether or not Proper_Noun exists, and turn up the heat ten fold. Imagine being asked by your child "Are we starving to death?" and knowing that there is no benefit in saying Proper_Noun even if it\'s true, and even if the child knows that you are indeed starving.The darkness, horror and sorrow amplify the bright spots. When the father finds a old can of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in a vending machine that had already been entirely looted ... and allows his son to have it (his first), you almost feel like you are watching a child open a Proper_Noun present. When you see the boy trying so hard to make his father share it with him, and the father trying so hard to make sure the son has every drop of it, it tears your heart out. As a father, I felt as if I were right there suffering with them.(spoilers below)I\'ll be honest ... there are no happy endings in this one. There is no promise land or savior. This story is about everything a father does in his short time on Earth to protect and prepare his child and in the end you are not even sure if he succeeded in his goals ... but what really stands out and cannot be missed is the beauty in the relationship and the painfully realistic way in which the author delivers. To many it may seem dry and dark ... but anyone who thinks that the dialog and activities in a world like this one would be anything else is missing the point.
