308By now we all know that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun disturbing post-apocalyptic novel centered around an unnamed man and his son and their struggle for survival. As was expected, many things in the novel are horrific yet described with Proper_Noun ability to see beauty in the grotesque (it is this fact, by the way, that makes me see him as more of Proper_Noun writer than Proper_Noun Western one). Most of these things are known about the novel by reading the first paragraph of the many, many reviews, but none of these things have anything to do with what makes the novel good or bad to me.I recently read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun and in many ways I was reminded of the war sections of that book while reading The Proper_Noun Not only are we looking at, in both, the ability of man to persevere even when all hope is gone, but one scene in The Proper_Noun of the man considering hiding out in Proper_Noun barn seemed so reminiscent of Proper_Noun similar scene in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun that I had to read it as some sort of tribute. Also we could look at the one image of hope in Proper_Noun novel as also taken from Proper_Noun as Proper_Noun Proper_Noun notes in her essay "Men at Proper_Noun from Proper_Noun comparisons to Proper_Noun end there. The language of The Proper_Noun may be verbose, more descriptive, but this is much bleaker than anything Proper_Noun read by Proper_Noun McCarthy, through repetitive struggles, similar scenes and the perpetual ash, pushes the reader into feeling some of the hopelessness felt by his characters. The lack of chapter breaks in the novel also helps to force us along. I made the mistake of often reading the book before bed and I fell asleep then with the images of burn and barren, ash-covered landscapes and the feeling that someone was always behind me, following, just out of sight.If we measure Proper_Noun book by its staying power, the way it continues to haunt and linger, The Proper_Noun surpasses many other books. If Proper_Noun asked, though, whether I "like" the book, I might not be able to answer convincingly in the affirmative.
