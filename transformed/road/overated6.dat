52I don\'t see what the hype is all about. Then again I read both Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun 1945" both by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and feel that the people in this story didn\'t have it so rough (I\'m not kidding, read about the siege of Proper_Noun and how families with children lived through two years of starvation and fighting and you won\'t sleep for a week).But there were also a few things in the story I couldn\'t "get".The father is a street smart survivalist but yet they are undertaking this huge walk to get to the coast. Such a walk is a major expense of calories/effort/shoes so it must be for a reason. For the hope of seeing the pretty seashore? No. In order to get away from the terrible conditions back home? Yes. But they come across marauders and killers and such on the road anyway so it doesn\'t seem to get any better for them. So what\'s the point? Why not give up on the idea and hunker down at one of the depots of food they seem to always come across just in the nick of time?Also for a survivalist the father is continually throwing things away (water jugs) when they get empty. As long as you are dragging a cart why not just take it? Maybe you\'ll need it later? And why are both characters walking instead of taking turns riding in the cart?The writing itself is fine but the conversations are completely wooden and mostly single-word responses that are dull the first time, boring the 20th time.Interestingly he uses apostrophe\'s for possessive words but not for contractions - "cant" "dont" Proper_Noun and so on. Why? Is this to signify that the positive side of the words Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun no longer exists in this world? Perhaps, but not explored.And why is the father trying to maintain the innocence of the child? You know the drill with this theme: "Protect the innocence of the poor unspoilt child under terrible circumstances" Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Is Proper_Noun but in this world clearly there is going to be no use for innocence. Doesn\'t the father know that when he dies this kid will be picked apart in a second if he can\'t take care of himself? Would the definition of "innocence" be different in this world? Not explored.Overall, I think Proper_Noun saw an episode or two of "Jericho", thought it was interesting, and banged out a book in the same vein. Somehow it got picked up by Proper_Noun as a miracle book and here we are. Its an OK book but its not a revelation.
