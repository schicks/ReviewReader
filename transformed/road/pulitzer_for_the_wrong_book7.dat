47First, I will say that The Proper_Noun is worth reading; it is a good book. However, it is not the masterpiece so many are proclaiming it to be; and, too, it is not Proper_Noun McCarthy\'s best novel (that would be Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun always admired Proper_Noun McCarthy for his minimalist prose, intriguing characters, and stunning insights into the more darker side of the human condition. It\'s rare for novelists to mine such seemingly malefic territory and draw from it some kind of beauty Proper_Noun understanding. (Joyce Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is another of those rare novelists that springs instantly to mind; she, like Proper_Noun McCarthy, is not afraid to shine a raw light onto aspects of human nature most other novelists would just as soon leave in the dark.)While Proper_Noun not read all of Proper_Noun McCarthy\'s novels, Proper_Noun read enough to know that I admire much of his work. For years, he has been regarded as one of Proper_Noun greatest writers; indeed, the heir apparent to Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Anyone who has read Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun would, I think, be hard pressed to deny such a mantle to Proper_Noun McCarthy.Whenever a new novel written by Proper_Noun McCarthy is released, I purchase it on its sale date. I had read some early reviews of The Proper_Noun and was eagerly anticipating its release. And though it is a novel that one may read quickly, I chose instead to take my time, lingering over the prose. I found myself moved by the novel; however, as it went on, I became somewhat disheartened. It became sadly repetitive and its dialogue so vague as to be almost banal. Not something Proper_Noun encountered in Proper_Noun McCarthy\'s work before. What I felt I was reading was in fact not a novel, but rather the notes for a novel Proper_Noun a screenplay that had yet to actually be written.The plot has been covered numerous times in other reviews; therefore, I will not repeat it here. What I will say is this: In a world that has grown so savage, and so many of its surviving humans so vicious, it seemed odd to me that the main characters ("the good guys," as they describe themselves) maneuvered through the dangerous landscape as easily as they did. For the first time, I felt as if Proper_Noun McCarthy were playing "the manipulative writer" rather than "the chronicler of specific lives."In other words, the seams showed; there was no moment when I truly feared for the man and the boy, for Proper_Noun McCarthy never relented in letting them get away from "the bad guys." Like the narrative description, this element persisted to a point in which I was more Proper_Noun less certain that I would not find myself surprised by a change of course. And it just didn\'t wash. To create such an ugly, dangerous, desperate world and then to let the main characters make it through that world more Proper_Noun less unscathed by the external evils -- it seemed more gimmick than story.The novel\'s saving grace, however, is to be found in the closing pages. Proper_Noun McCarthy comes alive here -- a little too late -- and the manner in which he chooses to end the novel is quite moving. The problem, of course, is that one has to slog through quite a bit of ash and mundane repetition to reach said point.When I finished the novel, I wondered if perhaps Proper_Noun missed something. It\'s not a book I wouldn\'t recommend Proper_Noun McCarthy is a stunning writer, whether one reads his better works Proper_Noun his lesser ones), but it is one for which I felt bewilderment when I learned that it had won the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Perhaps the board bent and decided to give Proper_Noun McCarthy the award after years of ignoring his other -- better and more deserving -- novels (see Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It rather cheapened the awards for me, especially considering the other novels released last year that were better than The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun -- to name a few).Of the Proper_Noun finalists, however, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was definitely the more deserving of said literary accolade. Like many great novels (Beloved, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun it teaches one how to read it. Its characters are fully human; its narrative gripping and gorgeously rendered; its themes stunning in both their beauty and complexity; and its investigation of American life -- in the new millenium and post-911 -- so sharp and clarified that I often had to set aside the book and regard my own similar feelings to such a dark and turbulent time. It\'s what the best novels do: remind us who we are, from what we come, and perhaps offer us a glimpse of where we may be headed.I might well have said the same about The Proper_Noun but it never struck me as being so fully realized as to stir such thoughts. It didn\'t tell me anything new that other post-apocalyptic fiction hadn\'t already touched and investigated. It seemed more like poetry crossed with the classic conventions of the Proper_Noun novel and sprinkled here and there with cryptic doses of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Romero.A good book, but not one deserving of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Sadly, in the future, Proper_Noun McCarthy will be regarded as "the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writer of The Proper_Noun when rather the accolade would better and more honestly read: "the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun author of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in stripping down his prose as to make it skeletally spartan, Proper_Noun McCarthy forgot -- as he didn\'t in other novels -- how to tell a full story about real human beings caught in the grip of real and extraordinary circumstances.I was moved, but I was not convinced. And that saddens me, for Proper_Noun McCarthy has been a writer whom Proper_Noun admired and respected for a good many years.Were he to win literature\'s highest accolade, it would have been better that he won for a novel worthy of the prize.It rather reminds me of this year\'s Proper_Noun Proper_Noun during which one of Proper_Noun greatest filmmakers won awards for a film that, while good, was certainly not his best -- and perhaps because the voting membership, in trying to assuage past failures, felt that a consolation prize was better than no prize at all.So, if one wishes to read and see the best of last year, then pick up Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun then walk over to the Proper_Noun section and pick out Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun film whose themes and milieu seem similar to those presented in Proper_Noun McCarthy\'s The Proper_Noun only more fully and honestly).
