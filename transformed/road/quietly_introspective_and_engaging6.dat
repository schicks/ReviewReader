5Spoiler-free!This book certainly does Proper_Noun fall victim to cliches. It is Proper_Noun a feel-good, happy-ending kind of book, as you\'ve probably gathered already. I think that for this reason, it serves to disappoint anybody who is rather forced to read it, through school or any other institution, because it is dark and Proper_Noun very joyful, and the reader has to be looking for inspiration in order to find it.That being said, anybody who is curious and has a willing mind will get a lot out of this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think that negative reviews are indicative of people being unwilling to deal with a story that details basic human beings in hopeless conditions, and writing this off as Proper_Noun Neither of the main characters are extraordinary people, they are just people trying to survive. They still have flaws. They still have doubts. There is no light for them at the end of the tunnel. That\'s what\'s unique about this book, though; the excitement and insight of it radiates from each character\'s raw humanity.Although it\'s been under some scrutiny, I am a fan of Proper_Noun diction and use (or non-use) of punctuation throughout the text. Commas, apostrophes and quotation marks are more or less absent, and sentences are either short and incomplete, or they run on. To me, desperation is well-communicated through these devices.Also, you\'ll find amazing imagery here. You have to have a dried up imagination Proper_Noun to be in awe of the pictures your own mind will create.Don\'t read this book if you:lack imaginationlack opennessare faint of heartare hopelessly pessimisticare bored with your life...because the book will only bore and/or depress you. This one is for the textually ambitious. As stated previously, the inspiration and beauty of this book will Proper_Noun gift wrap itself and appear in front of your eyes.Enjoy!
