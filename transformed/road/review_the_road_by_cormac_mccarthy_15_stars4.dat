755Review: THE Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun starsThe author wrote. Short sentences. Clipped and cold, like the air of his novel. Ash covering everything. He stumbled forward.Why dont we use apostrophes, Proper_Noun dont know. We dont use quotation marks either.Is it confusing?Maybe. But we do use pathetic fallacy.What\'s pafethic phallacy?Pathetic fallacy. "To signify any description of inanimate natural objects that ascribes to them human capabilities, sensations, and emotions."Oh. Like the weather? Like nature?Yes, like nature.Does it hate us?No, it doesn\'t hate us. But the author does. He wants to manipulate emotional responses in readers to our relationship by making us suffer. He wants to explore me, an ordinary man, in an extraordinary circumstance.Is it interesting?Not really.He made the characters fashion shoes out of refuse, light fires, look for food, lay listening, push the cart, and sleep together in the cold. Again and again. And again for good measure. And once more. And he aped Proper_Noun plot devices. Hidden fallout shelter. Headless baby on a spit. Limb-by-limb cannabalism Proper_Noun senseless as that is). The capsized ship. Marching, chained catamites.There is no cliche in the literature\'s long history that is not honored here throughout. Whatever form they spoke of they were included. Mad Proper_Noun interrupted by King Proper_Noun Proper_Noun . And you knew all along that terms like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun beauty", Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun would pop up in reviews like bingo calls at the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ashen prose covered everything. But then, in fits, the lyricism would appear like a blossom on a turd with the Proper_Noun sprouting into Proper_Noun The reticulate sky would wrinkle its vermiculate back to expose a cloying sentimentality lacquered by logorrhea--a cheesy mysticism lurking behind the cracked, Proper_Noun veneer. But here the sun never rose, for the old man and his scion, the bell tolled and all wrapped up in a startling deus ex via as the hooded, stoven-boned veteran hove into view and whisked our boy off to some humming deep-glen mystery older than man.
