8If you are prone to depression, The Proper_Noun may not be the book for you; On the other hand, perhaps the world described in the book would give you a different perspective on your life and it may help! In any case, The Proper_Noun is a unique read. The story is really about a fathers love for his son against all odds. There is more in what goes unsaid between these characters than in what is said. The dialog is sparse, yet anyone with a child can see the complex nature of the relationship, even when words are few.McCarthy chose not to give any clues on what exactly caused the post-apocalyptic world that is the backdrop of the book. That was a bit of a struggle for me, because absolutely everything is dead (grass, trees...everything), but even following the worst nuclear holocaust there would be some vegetation, insects, and animals likely to survive. And if everything else is dead, how did any humans make it? But I got past that, because I think Proper_Noun wanted the reader to see the bold color that is the love between father and son against an entirely black and grey surrounding. Kind of like the one girl in the colored dress in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun have questioned the redundancy of the story and lack of plot. I do not. I think Proper_Noun knew exactly what he was doing; he wanted readers to see how these characters could bear to keep living through the same horrendous conditions Proper_Noun after day, with no real hope in sight. There really isn\'t a plot, but I believe that was intentional too. There is no `plot\' in the lives of the characters, so weaving some kind of plot into the book would have been a cop out in my humble opinion.Anyway, good book, and very different. Those who compared this with The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun completely missed the point.
