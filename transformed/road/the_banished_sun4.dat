6There is a line in this book which to me encapsulates the spirit of the entire book:"...By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp." I have read and re-read this sentence more than any other in the novel, so profound was its effect on me. I was prepared to dislike Proper_Noun vision of the decline of civilization in the wake of the apocalypse. After finally reading it, however, I have realized that this is the finest piece of literature Proper_Noun absorbed in a very long time. A simple story, really - but not an easy read. It disturbs, haunts, and resonates with me on the deepest level as I cannot stop thinking about it. I am shaken to the core.McCarthy\'s use of language is astonishing. He drives his message home with spare yet powerful prose; I felt I was traveling alongside the man and his boy as they carried on with grim determination down the road. I felt the horror of it all: the knowledge that there is no life save that of the few survivors. No more plants, no more animals, no hope whatsoever. The depravity of those who would rape, kill and eat other people all for the sake of survival in a dead world. But Proper_Noun seldom gives lurid details and when he does, he does not linger on them. This is one of the reasons I love his writing style. I like the clipped sentences and conversations. It rang true to me, though I can see why there are those who dislike this book. It is not a fast moving, richly detailed adventure story and there are no heroes. Proper_Noun read several other of Proper_Noun books and must say that his style is perfectly suited to this story, and the style is an acquired taste, I think. Some like it, some hate it. As for me, Proper_Noun never be the same again.
