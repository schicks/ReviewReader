6I have to say that I kept putting off reading The Proper_Noun Finally I picked it up and began to read it. It was a very simple book, which really surprised me. I thought there could have been more to the book than there was. I was also suprised that the pages were all double spaced and actually alot of lines just had a few words on them. It took only a short time to read this book. I guess I am not fancy enough to get all the hype that this book got. I wish there would have been a little more explanations about the people and there surroundings. I did not love the book, however, I did not hate it either. It is worth reading considering it is so short.
