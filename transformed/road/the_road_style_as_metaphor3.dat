15In Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun creates a nightmarish apocalyptic vision of a country wrecked by some unnamed upheaval. Proper_Noun is not Proper_Noun first writer to portray a wasted landscape, but what marks this novel as special is his ability to keep Proper_Noun reader involved in a story that is as nearly devoid of plot as any book I have read. An unnamed man and his young son tread Proper_Noun Proper_Noun States seeking food and survival in a time and place that offer very little hope of achieving either. From Proper_Noun first page to Proper_Noun last, they walk, they talk, and very occasionally encounter other survivors. Yet, it is a disservice to literature to expect that any novel must follow traditional lines of character development, plot complication, and other areas that we normally expect to find. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is thus not a plot driven work. It is theme propelled, with Proper_Noun careful reader being rewarded with what seems to be ordinary conversation but instead Proper_Noun duo\'s comments to each other reveal a breathtaking universe of despair that is only slightly leavened by an ending that suggests that even in this blighted landscape of crunching loneliness there is a smidgeon of optimism that not even a nuclear winter can crush.As I read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I was reminded of Proper_Noun similar bleak countryside of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun much anthologized short story, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In both works, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun allow Proper_Noun landscape to speak and act as eloquently as any human can. Where Proper_Noun atom blasted Proper_Noun States suggests a continuity of human compassion, Proper_Noun delves more deeply into Proper_Noun morass of nihilism that does not allow its inhabitants to know for sure what distinguishes Proper_Noun good guys from Proper_Noun bad. The son often questions his father as to whether they are good when he sees that his father is quite willing to kill others merely to ensure their own survival. Such questions strike directly at Proper_Noun core of what it is to be human. Proper_Noun provides no easy answers as Proper_Noun father drills his son with Proper_Noun needed mentality to be a survivor.Then there is Proper_Noun blighted land itself. Nowhere in Proper_Noun book does Proper_Noun sun shine brightly. Instead a corrosive grayness covers all. The duo often have trouble even seeing clearly for a short distance. Rain is frequent and chilling. It is as if nature itself has turned against humanity by creating an anti-Eden from which all fruit has been banned. It matters little whether this blight originated from massive nuclear strikes or asteroid collisions. What matters more is how Proper_Noun very few survivors manage to live while maintaining a bare semblance of what they used to call humanity. Even their clipped conversations are fragmented. Language has become as crippled as Proper_Noun humans walking on their Road that starts nowhere and leads nowhere. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun then is a truly nightmarish vision of a world gone mad, and no one can retain either his sanity or his normalcy. The reader is luckier. He can close Proper_Noun book to see Proper_Noun sun and ponder how thin is Proper_Noun line between this world and that.
