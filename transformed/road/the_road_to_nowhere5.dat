284My review will be done as dialogue presented in the same style and format as dialogue appears in this book (grammatical errors intentional): The boy looked at the man. So, did you like the book? It was ok. Just ok? Yes, just ok. Why didn\'t you like it? I don\'t know. You don\'t know? I guess it really didn\'t go anywhere. It just kind of meandered. It did? Walk, search for food, build a fire, try to stay dry, avoid the bad people and then get up and do it all over again. Is that what happens? It did. The characters, except for one, didn\'t have names so sometimes there would be two he\'s referred to in the same paragraph and you did not know which he was he. Huh? And the dialogue did not use quotation marks. Apparently established authors can break grammatical rules and people will think it is genius. I suppose. And when dialogue ran several lines, the author didn\'t use said to break up who was talking so you didn\'t know if it was that he or the other he talking after a while. Who? He. I\'m not even sure who you are talking about. Me neither. I\'m not sure which one of us is talking right now either. Me neither. Will we be ok? You mean you and me? Yeah . . . I guess. Did you say that or did I say that? Who cares.
