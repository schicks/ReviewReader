6or, The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun If He Were Proper_Noun Proper_Noun just finished Proper_Noun Proper_Noun last night and am still trying to sort my feelings on Proper_Noun book out, so I trust you\'ll forgive Proper_Noun somewhat disjointed nature of this review.I wrote down Proper_Noun bunch of words/phrases that came immediately to mind upon finishing Proper_Noun novel. Here are some of them:Tragic. Bleak. Brutal. Cosmic horror Proper_Noun it]. Gallows humor in Proper_Noun dialogue. Hemingwayesque. Hard for parents. Hard for children. Hard to take in general. Sad, sad, sad.Sounds pretty bad, doesn\'t it? Considering that this is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun autophagia of Proper_Noun human race, did you really expect any different?I\'m making this book sound awful. It isn\'t. It\'s brilliant and it\'s incredibly moving. It\'s just that Proper_Noun puts his characters in an incredibly grim situation and pulls no punches in telling us about it. Reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun makes you realize just how silly and ephemeral most fiction really is. To give it less than 5 stars Proper_Noun be an enormous injustice.
