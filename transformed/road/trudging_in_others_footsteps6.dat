11Quite frankly, I found this book disappointing. McCarthy is an indisputably good novelist, but this seemed phoned in.Some have praised its style as spare, terse, in keeping with its subject and tone. They make a similar argument to explain the fact that the plot basically starts nowhere particular, ends nowhere particular and doesn\'t traverse anything particularly interesting en route. Well, of course! It\'s supposed to be, like, existential!This sort of analysis makes for interesting reviews. But Proper_Noun the reader, see the flip side. The narrative lacks richness, and my take is that this mirrors a simple lack of engagement on Proper_Noun part rather than being a deliberate stylistic reflection of the post-apocalyptic world it\'s intended to evoke.Perhaps I\'ve been spoiled by a youthful interest in Proper_Noun that exposed me to quite a few stories in this genre, by authors from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Clarke to the considerably less well-known Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun "The Proper_Noun breaks no new ground and these lesser-known writers commendably invested the effort to craft their stories with considerably greater care. My recommendation for a more inventively conceived and better realized post-apocalypse tale still remains Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Miller\'s classic Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for Proper_Noun
