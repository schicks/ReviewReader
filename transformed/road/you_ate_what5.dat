28Page after page of graphic descriptions of living in a world where everything is gray and burned and long dead bodies are littered around. A father and son are living on the edge of starvation and in fear of cannibals. Food fortuitiously appears as they are about to starve. Just about the time that your willingness to go along with the plot is at the breaking point, you are told that they had "peaches and cream" (?) for breakfast in an abandoned bomb shelter from supplies left there years ago. Eventually the book comes to an end abruptly with no point or resolution.
