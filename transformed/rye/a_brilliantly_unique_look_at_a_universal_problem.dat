It is for this very reason that The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun has become one of the most beloved and enduring works in world literature.As always, Proper_Noun writing is so brilliant, his characters so real, that he need not employ artifice of any kind. This is a study of the complex problems haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Proper_Noun wisely chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple.This is not to say that The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is a straightforward and simple book. It is anything but. In it we are privy to Proper_Noun genius and originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner. The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is a book that can be loved and understood on many different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live.A work of true genius, images of a Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun are abundantly apparent throughout this book.While analyzing the Proper_Noun raging about him, Proper_Noun attention is captured by a child walking in the street "singing and humming." Realizing that the child is singing the familiar refrain, "If a body meet a body, comin\' through the rye," Proper_Noun himself, says that he feels "not so depressed."The title\'s words, however, are more than just a pretty ditty that Proper_Noun happens to like. In the stroke of pure genius that is Proper_Noun himself, he wisely sums up the book\'s theme in its title.When Proper_Noun whose past has been traumatic, to say the least, is questioned by his younger sister, Proper_Noun regarding what he would like to do when he gets older, Proper_Noun replies, "Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of Proper_Noun and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody\'s around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And Proper_Noun standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they\'re running and they don\'t look where they\'re going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That\'s all Proper_Noun do all day. Proper_Noun just be the Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun and all. I know it\'s crazy, but that\'s the only thing Proper_Noun really like to be."In this short bit of dialogue Proper_Noun brilliantly exposes Proper_Noun deepest desire and expounds the book\'s theme. Proper_Noun wishes to preserve something of childhood innocence that gets hopelessly lost as we grow into the crazy and phony world of adulthood.The theme of lost innocence is deftly explored by Proper_Noun throughout the book. Proper_Noun is appalled when he encounters profanity scrawled on the walls of Proper_Noun school, a school that he envisions protecting and shielding children from the evils of society.When Proper_Noun gives his red hunting cap to Proper_Noun to wear, he gives it to her as a shield, an emblem of the eternal love and protectiveness he feels for her.Near the beginning of the book, Proper_Noun remembers a girl he once knew, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun with whom he played checkers. Proper_Noun he remembers, "wouldn\'t move any of her kings," and action Proper_Noun realizes to be a metaphor of her naivete. When Proper_Noun hears that his sexually experienced prep school roommate had a date with Proper_Noun he immediately starts a fight with him, symbolically protecting Proper_Noun innocence.More sophisticated readers might question the reasons behind Proper_Noun plight. While Proper_Noun feelings are universal, this character does seem to be a rather extreme example. The catalyst for Proper_Noun desires is no doubt the death of his younger brother, Proper_Noun a bright and loving boy who died of leukemia at the age of thirteen. Proper_Noun still feels the sting of Proper_Noun death acutely, as well as his own, albeit undeserved, guilt, in being able to do nothing to prevent Proper_Noun suffering.The only reminder Proper_Noun has of Proper_Noun shining but all-too-short life, is Proper_Noun baseball mitt which is covered with poems Proper_Noun read while standing in the outfield. In a particularly poignant moment, Proper_Noun tells us that this is the glove he would want to use to catch children when they fall from the cliff of innocence.In an interesting, but trademark, Proper_Noun twist, Proper_Noun distorts the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun poem that provides the book\'s title. Originally, it read, "If a body meet a body, comin\' through the rye." Proper_Noun distorts the word Proper_Noun into Proper_Noun This is certainly not the first time Proper_Noun is guilty of distortion; indeed he is a master at it.This distortion, however, shows us how much Proper_Noun death has affected Proper_Noun and also how much he fears his own fall from innocence, the theme that threads its way throughout the whole of the book.By this amazing book\'s end, we must reach the conclusion that there are times when we all need a "catcher in the rye." We are, indeed, blessed if we have one.
