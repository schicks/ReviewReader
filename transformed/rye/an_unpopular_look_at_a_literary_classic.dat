44As one of those `classics of literature\', Proper_Noun almost seems sacrilegious Proper_Noun criticize a critical success like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun Well, I can\'t help but feel as though the novel\'s garnered respect and praise is a little much when you actually consider how little the novel really says about adolescence. Sure, Proper_Noun tries (and at times succeeds) Proper_Noun convey a feeling of apathetic innocence, but its construction is rather off-putting and it\'s overall anticlimactic result is less ambiguously rewarding and more strangely hollow.`The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is an ambitious story that attempts Proper_Noun say a lot but fails Proper_Noun really live up Proper_Noun its potential.The novel tells of two mere days in the life of the recently expelled sixteen-year-old Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Not wanting Proper_Noun face the wrath of his parents, Proper_Noun decides Proper_Noun avoid home Proper_Noun a few days (until he\'s expected back), living on his own in the city. The premise is merely a foundation Proper_Noun Proper_Noun simplistic views and reasoning\'s concerning life and his future. He considers everyone around him Proper_Noun be fake and undeserving of his time, yet Proper_Noun is obvious that Proper_Noun is just as `phony\' as the rest of them. He goes on dates, gets trashed at bars, sneaks off Proper_Noun visit his sister, imposes (or does he) on a former teacher and even has a run in with a pimp.Sadly, all of this is conveyed in Proper_Noun uninteresting and at times aggravating delivery.I\'m not trying Proper_Noun lighten the point which Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was trying Proper_Noun make, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is a very poignant (maybe even more so today then when the novel was actually written) point. Our young ones are just as misplaced and confused as Proper_Noun and so his tale of apathy masked desperation is one that we could all learn from; but Proper_Noun loses my patience with his redundancy. Some have complained of the same thing, which I was pleased Proper_Noun see (it proves that some people are willing Proper_Noun think outside of the preordained box). Proper_Noun says the same thing on just about every page, so much so that the surprise is stripped from us and we are left with a predictable tale of teenage angst. Maybe that was the point, Proper_Noun expose the lack of genuine life that resides inside someone of Proper_Noun nature. He thinks that he is the only Proper_Noun person around yet Proper_Noun is obvious Proper_Noun all onlookers that he is basically walking death. He is offering nothing, yet he `has\' potential; or so we are told.The story is crucial yet the delivery makes this a difficult read, one that you almost don\'t want Proper_Noun bother with. I\'ve read novels that are hard Proper_Noun read due Proper_Noun their construction, yet they possess a certain otherworldliness that make then necessary (look at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun just that), but Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun lacks the emotional connection needed Proper_Noun make Proper_Noun worth suffering through. In the end the novels brilliant moments (like Proper_Noun confession as Proper_Noun what Proper_Noun is he really wants Proper_Noun be) are masked by all of the mediocre (or just plain uninspiring) ones, leaving us with a novel that feels incomplete and a concept that deserved so much more Proper_Noun Proper_Noun got.And the ending, I just have this Proper_Noun say. I am all Proper_Noun the anticlimactic; believe me. I relish in the idea of a simple `stop\' put Proper_Noun a novel, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun allows the reader Proper_Noun move on with a sense of personalized closure. I often think of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in particular `Less Proper_Noun Proper_Noun when I think of that sort of ending; an open ended closing that leaves you deciding the fates of the characters yourself. If often works beautifully, but here Proper_Noun seems rather empty as apposed Proper_Noun rich with meaning.I just kind of shrugged Proper_Noun off because I didn\'t really Proper_Noun what happened next.One might protest that that is the point, that we aren\'t supposed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun about Proper_Noun thus furthering the poignancy of Proper_Noun point; but Proper_Noun them I have only this Proper_Noun say: "YOU HAVE Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun You cannot reach an audience if they are not moved. If we adopt the same apathetic attitude of the main character then we simply have not achieved the desired response. If this novel is Proper_Noun mean anything then we have Proper_Noun be stunned, mortified and moved Proper_Noun action because of it; and Proper_Noun that Proper_Noun happen Proper_Noun has Proper_Noun be delivered in a way that actually Proper_Noun us. For me, and apparently a few others, Proper_Noun didn\'t do that.I know that I am in the minority here, but I have Proper_Noun speak my truth.
