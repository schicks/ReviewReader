11When reading The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun Salinger, you should keep in mind that it takes place in the late forties. Customs and the way people go about things were very different than they are now. Or, maybe it\'s just the way Proper_Noun the main character, reacts to the events in his life. The Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun is about a seventeen-year-old boy, Proper_Noun who drops out of prep school, without telling his parents. This leads to him hanging around Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in the days preceding Proper_Noun break. He is your typical rebelling teenage boy. He tends to use lots or crude language and enjoys rather large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Some common phrases Proper_Noun uses are: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mean what the hell am I doing?", "Jesus! What the hell happened to you!", "That depressed the hell outta me", and Proper_Noun Although, when faced with the opportunity for a prostitute he takes it, but when she arrives, he can\'t bring himself to commit the act. That seems to be the only real commendable thing about Proper_Noun The only other thing that I liked about this book was the relationship Proper_Noun had with his younger sister, Proper_Noun Here is a quote that shows how Proper_Noun cares for Proper_Noun "I\'m going with you. Can Proper_Noun Okay? Please." "No. Shut up. You\'re not going. Now, shut up." This is the part where Proper_Noun decides he is going to go out west and Proper_Noun wants to go with him, but he won\'t let her. This caring feeling that Proper_Noun has for Proper_Noun also comes through in other parts of the book.At the end, problems are solved, but not in a reasonable or logical manner.I didn\'t get much of anything out of this book at all. There\'s really no lesson learned, point or objective and not much of a happily ever after either. Personally, this book could and should have lasted much longer. The author could have spend more time really getting to the bottom of Proper_Noun problems and telling more about how things turned out for Proper_Noun It just seems like he got tired of writing the book and took the easy way out. The last chapter: "That\'s all Proper_Noun going to tell you about. I could probably tell you about what I did after I went home, how I got sick and all, and what school Proper_Noun supposed to go to next fall, after I get out f here, but I don\'t feel like it. I really don\'t. That stuff doesn\'t really interest me too much right now." This book may be considered a classic, but I don\'t see what makes it that way.
