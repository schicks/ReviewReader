17Like it or not, there is a little Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in all of us. Who hasn\'t been disgusted with his present situation at one time or another, with the same drab setting and boring people, the same tedious authority figures, the seemingly inescapable occupational path laid out in front of him? Proper_Noun is our phony-exposing id, getting kicked out of school, running away from convention, and telling anyone in his path exactly like it is. I, for one, feel like there\'s as many frauds around now as there were in Proper_Noun world Proper_Noun Proper_Noun boarding school establishment in the 1950\'s)- just pick up any paper- and would love to at times similarly pack up and escape them all.Caufield\'s heart is in the right place throughout this tale of, essentially, a young man\'s mild descent into madness (I say mild because it is accompanied by none of the gun-wielding trauma we have come to associate with disillusionment among today\'s post-Columbine teens). He says goodbye to a professor at the boarding school he\'s tossed from; he defends an old girlfriend\'s honor from his cad roommate; he fondly and regretfully reminisces about his dead younger brother; and he dotes on his sister Proper_Noun throughout, even entering his parents\' house under the cover of darkness (and in a drunken stupor) to check in on her while she slept. When he visits her at school and takes her to the park the next day, right at the brink of his collapse and threatening to leave his environment forever, the scene is as touching as it is suspenseful.I would like to have seen more resolution from this story, such as his making contact with his unrequited love, who was never mentioned after Proper_Noun fought his roommate for dating her. However, I recognize Proper_Noun is more about one errant weekend- albeit a very revealing one- than it is Proper_Noun life\'s story. Plus, the surprise ending merits a mere couple of paragraphs, and the merest of allusions within them, yet exceeds the rest of this book in its power.
