2I had never read this (failed education system I suppose) and now that Proper_Noun read it I really don\'t get what the hype is about. The book is just about a whiny teenager who really likes the word "crumby". He smokes, walks around, complains, complains, complains, gets in trouble and complains some more. Maybe I missed out on this coming of age story since I didn\'t read it when I was a teenager and could better understand Proper_Noun but I really just wanted to punch his face. I suppose it\'s worth a read to say you\'ve read it and you\'re a good member of society, but really you could just look up the sparknotes and call it a day.
