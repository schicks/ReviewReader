13I was interested in reading "Catcher" due to its history from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun up to its inclusion in "Conspiracy Proper_Noun As an aspiring writer, I was very impressed and entralled by the style throughout the book. I loved the conversational writing and feel that\'s at least 50% of the charm of the book. It\'s very engrossing and very true-to-life. I don\'t want to read a literary work that reads like a Proper_Noun report. Conversations have real language, descriptions, tangents etc --- and "Catcher" is Proper_Noun story of depression.Which brings me to another reason for liking the book.....I can relate to Proper_Noun plight. I\'m now 20 and a sophomore in college, but I feel very isolated away from home. I have very few friends at college, and many of my high school friends have changed drastically. I\'m changing, too, and I feel like I don\'t have anyone I can relate to. As "corny" as it may sound, I relate with Proper_Noun and his isolation from society.But not everyone will have that relationship with the character. I believe many who read it will find a piece of themselves floating around in Proper_Noun mind, though. Be warned that it is not a "plot" book, as many reviewers have complained. True - It doesn\'t have a plot, per se, but it is an interesting story that through reading, I think, allows for much self-evaluation while Proper_Noun searches for himself and his role in society.If anyone would like to discuss the book, feel free to e-mail me!
