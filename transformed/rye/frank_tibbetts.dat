3This has just become my favorite book of all time. I laughed so hard all the way through this!Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of Proper_Noun school. He decides to embark on his own journey home and he takes us through a comical adventure through Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It is a masterfully crafted manuscript directed to the reader in such a way, that one can see the nostalgic, yet rebellious attitude of teenagers in the 1950\'s. I felt that not much has changed in the last 60 years!The reader can sense that Proper_Noun is a troubled youth, and the root of his \'I don\'t care\' attitude stems from the death of his brother.(Though, he\'ll never admit it.)I hardly found a sentence in this entire book where I didn\'t laugh at his humorous negativity. Author Proper_Noun Proper_Noun took ten years to write this book, and I wonder how in the world he was able to capture so much humor in American youth. I think he was a genious.Holden is my hero \'and all\'. This book is definitely a masterpiece and I urge anyone who has a good sense of humor to buy this book. You will want to read this book over and over. My advice? Buy it in hardback!The language is a bit on the rough side, but it makes the character more believable. Proper_Noun is the original rebel with a cause!
