85I am a college teacher (math), and every term I give my new students a questionnaire. Among the questions I often ask is "Name one book, movie, TV show, or piece of music as your all time favorite, and explain why." "Catcher in the Proper_Noun has been cited more often than any other book, and I finally decided to find out why. I\'m Proper_Noun trying to find out why. If my students relate to this book, then they are more bitter and loutish than they appear to be in my classes and out-of-class conversations. I regret that those who attack the book have often done so on the grounds of its vulgarity. That just devalues their argument. The fact is that the book is lousy because it portrays as a hero a teenage kid who is nothing but a bitter, maladjusted punk. He interprets courtesy as phoniness, and in fact assumes that anyone who doesn\'t immediately give him whatever he feels like having must be cruel, or a phony, or just generally subhuman. This kid is supposed to be teaching us something about life? About adolescence? He\'s learning about himself? He has no interest in any of that - he\'s interested only in what other people can do for him. He is sensitive to nothing but his own feelings. If you liked the movie "Five Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - another portrayal of an "alienated" and oh-so-sensitive lout which caused the critics to cream their jeans - then you\'d probably like "Catcher in the Proper_Noun The world is full of bitterly unhappy people who confuse cynicism and hostility toward the world with artistic sensitivity. Many of them write reviews of books and movies, as they have done here. But avoid such people. They live lives of misery, and spread the misery around so they don\'t have to be alone in their hatred of the world. And "Catcher in the Proper_Noun is their favorite book.
