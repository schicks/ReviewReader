3J.D. Salinger published this reputed American classic in 1951, which was probably the most censored book in high schools and libraries until the mid 1980s. I\'m not sure why it\'s considered a classic other than the fact that professors and publishers like looking for hidden meanings in each chapter. I\'m not saying that I didn\'t like the novel, because I did enjoy it, but mainly because I think Salinger\'s descriptions and language usage of the late 1940s was terrific. I forgot about the word "crumby"- meaning inadequate, or "phony"- meaning pretentious. The narrator and protagonist of the novel, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ( a seventeen year old boy ) uses these words a lot in his narration. And how about "flitty", or referring to people as "old" this or that? The writing in this novel is very strong, but the story is moderate at best to this reviewer. I don\'t see myself debating hidden meanings with anybody. I\'m assuming it was censored in schools because of sexual allusions, the morality codes of the 1940s and 50s, family values and some coarse language ( very mild compared to today\'s language). The thing that puzzles me is the title of the book! Proper_Noun is walking through Proper_Noun and hears a little boy singing a song to himself. Proper_Noun up with the title of the book? Shmoop states: Proper_Noun up indeed. The first mention we get of this mysterious catcher in this mysterious rye is when Proper_Noun overhears a little kid singing, "If a body catch a body coming through the rye." Momentarily, it makes him feel not so depressed, in part because Proper_Noun is a fan of little children, and the only things better than little children are little children who are singing." Apparently, Proper_Noun sees himself as the catcher in the rye catching the children as they fall off a cliff as he construed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 1796 poem. Who knows? Salinger was a kind of recluse and didn\'t give many interviews.The book starts off with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun ( our protagonist ) in a hospital in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun narrating the story of his previous Proper_Noun adventures in Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun The reader doesn\'t know whether it\'s a mental or physical hospital. Maybe that is Proper_Noun of the debatable points of this book. Anyway, he is being expelled from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun The reader gets the feeling that this isn\'t the first school that he\'s been thrown out of. He doesn\'t seem to see why learning is important, doesn\'t get along with his teachers, or roommates, and doesn\'t seem to respect his very successful parents. And what does his `red hunting hat\' symbolize? He heads to Proper_Noun several days before his parents will receive the letter from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun saying that he has been expelled. In Proper_Noun he books a cheap hotel and pines about his life. He likes to drink, smoke and make an ass of himself. He contacts previous girlfriend Proper_Noun and makes a mess of things. He constantly thinks about calling another old flame Proper_Noun but never does. He contacts his sister Proper_Noun and an old teacher Proper_Noun Antolini. The crux of the story is what happens on his adventures in Proper_Noun and the big debate with literary scrappers is : Proper_Noun up with his mental health, and what does his movements mean? As far as this reader is concerned- who cares, just read and enjoy!I wonder after reading this book if this Proper_Noun Proper_Noun character is really Proper_Noun Salinger as a young man. I had the same feeling when reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Anyway, you literary debaters, I think if you re-read page 170 you will find out how Proper_Noun Proper_Noun really feels about school and life: "You ought to go to a boy\'s school sometime. Try it sometime," I said. "It\'s full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Proper_Noun some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques". Metaphorically speaking, I think Proper_Noun was literally drowning in boredom. Anyway, enough thoughts about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun mental state that is being puppeteered by the cloistered Proper_Noun Salinger! Just grab a copy and form your own opinions.
