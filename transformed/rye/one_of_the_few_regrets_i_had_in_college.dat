2I\'m not a big reader, never have been and still not one today. I was able to avoid many literature classes in school but this was one of the books I was eventually forced to read in college. At the time, I was glad I read it since it was one of few books I felt I could easily understand and relate to.That said, at the end of the semester, I sold all my books to a local store, including this one that I got a whole 25 cents for (hey, every penny counts in college)! I regretted selling this book back almost immediately so a few short years later, I bought this book again. Even after almost 20 years, I still have fond memories of reading this and I proudly have this as part of my personal library.I won\'t go into all the details of the book since many reviewers have already done that. However, I must add that most "classics" are not readable for me. They were written at a different time, using seemingly different language, typically about a different culture so that my brain has to work really hard to muscle through them. In this book, Proper_Noun created a universal story that anyone, not only English majors and habitual readers, can thoroughly enjoy. Buy it, read it, and give it to your kids one day. Unlike many "classics", this one is truly timeless.
