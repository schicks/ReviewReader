17This book is extremely overrated. While I appreciate Proper_Noun writing style, the story itself is pointless. Holden Proper_Noun whines for 200-odd pages. This is somehow supposed to be relevant or edgy, but really it is just boring. The reader is given no reason to like or care about Proper_Noun or his story. Why people gush over this book is beyond me. All Proper_Noun has done is to paint a stereotype of a weak, callous, angry young man. I feel sorry for anyone who says they "relate" to this book, because it is clearly a condemnation on Proper_Noun part of youth in general, which I believe is unfair.
