15I loved the book, mostly the part about the lake. I think the lake is a metaphor for Proper_Noun personality. He always wonder where are the ducks going when the lake is frozen (I read it in hebrew and I don\'t recommaned in hebrew but I don\'t know the english sentence). THe ducks are symbol if his life, he\'s wondering where his life is ging 2 take him. When he gets to the lake he see that it not all frozen, I think like him. THe frozen area is his outside prsonality that is hard and watching on the inside, the unfrozen area - he toughts and way of mind. It\'s seems like, only us, the readers know his toughts and know they aren\'t frozen. I really enjoyed the book Proper_Noun I gave u something 2 think about.
