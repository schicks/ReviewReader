36I have been reading many of the reviews on this page, some critical, some positive, and I have condensed the opinions to the following. Those who don\'t like the book seem to think that the book is disconnected, swears too frequently, or has no plot. Now, I realize that some negative reviewers have differing opinions, and I respect them, because the book is different from most literature, classic or otherwise.Most literature describes an event, using the characters to interact with their surroundings. There is a defined plot, there is a defined theme, the people do normal things, and everybody who reads it gets pretty much the same thing from it. For an example, Proper_Noun quickly examine a well-known piece of literature, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun I am Proper_Noun going to go into great detail, I am Proper_Noun an expert on this work, but when I say Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun you see ghosts, kids with canes, and Proper_Noun If asked "what is it about" you might say, Proper_Noun redemption of Proper_Noun okay great. Everyone agrees, discussion ended."The Catcher in the Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun like that. People with literal minds hate books like this, because everyone who reads it, takes something different from it. These people say, "nothing happens, the symbolism was great, but there was no plot". To them I say, "Who cares?". I want to meet the person who declared that every book needs clearly defined plot, theme and grammar, to be good. Writing is about more than following the proper steps. A monkey can be taught to follow steps, a third grade student can learn to fill in blanks. Writing is about communicating. Some critics look at a work of Proper_Noun and say, Proper_Noun there\'s a good book, that\'s how writing is to be done. All the concepts are well thought out, the grammar is letter-perfect, and the word choice is outstanding!" And that is great for them, Proper_Noun excited that they feel this way, now we know that there is yet another job that a computer can be taught to do, critique literature based on grammar, punctuation and spelling. These rules are rules we give our elementary students so they can be understood when they write. If you want to buy a book, so you can examine grammar and word usage, don\'t buy this one. Proper_Noun didn\'t sit down to write a book for his college Proper_Noun professor. If you want to look at his work from that standpoint, then it would be an awful book.Fortunately for the human race, writing is Proper_Noun about that at all. Writing is Proper_Noun only about being understood, writing is about feeling, writing is about telling another human being, what an experience is like. This is what Proper_Noun has done. He has captured the teenage experience, the anger, the frustration, the disappointment, the feeling of hopelessness, the paranoia, and the feeling of looking out at society and realizing that it\'s Proper_Noun a nice place to be. Proper_Noun did Proper_Noun write about the idea teenager, if he did, Proper_Noun would\'ve sounded like a member of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun world is a happy place". Often, people like to rationalize what happened in this book, by saying, Proper_Noun is sick, he is unusual, nobody else goes through this" this is Proper_Noun the case. True, Proper_Noun did move to Proper_Noun apparently to seek some type of counseling, but he is far from unusual, he is truthful to himself, he is telling about the world the way it is, Proper_Noun the way he wants it to be.In the book, Proper_Noun is communicating to two types of people. On one hand he is telling the people whose lives have been like Proper_Noun that someone understands them. Someone else has been though what you\'ve been through, it\'s a normal thing. And he is telling the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun people "WAKE Proper_Noun Take off your rosy colored glasses, the world is Proper_Noun one big happy place, at least Proper_Noun for everyone. Yes, somewhere in the distance, there is war and hunger, but there is something more, and it\'s right next to you. There are people who can\'t find the most basic human need, the need to be loved and accepted." Proper_Noun feels lost and alone, he feels like nobody cares about him, he feels rejected by his family, and he feels hopeless because he everyone and everything he knows either lets him down, or lies to him. This is real life, this is what it\'s like to have everything Proper_Noun go your way. If you are looking for fairy tale or soap opera, this is the wrong book. You also shouldn\'t read this book if you are going to use a holier-than-thou attitude and judge everything that is wrong. To read this book, you need to be realistic, and empathetic. This book is about the bad side of life, it can sometimes be hard to follow, and you may reach the end and wonder what happens next. Read it a few times in that case, you may learn that this kind of writing is Proper_Noun about what happens next, it\'s about what already happened, and most importantly; why?
