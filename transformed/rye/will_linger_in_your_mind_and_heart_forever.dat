1I\'m so glad I finally got around to reading this fabulous book. It\'s a quick read yet characters and situations linger. I\'ll never forget Proper_Noun Proper_Noun brilliant with a partially educated mind. He\'s naive yet recognizes perversion. He has big ideas, the ideas of a man, yet he is still partially, a child. He talks tough. Hearing his empathy, caring and sensitivity and bewilderment through that tough sounding language is both heartbreaking and endearing.Reading it seemed natural, personal and gripping. Only after I completed reading the last page and went on about my day for a few hours did I realize I had just finished reading a masterpiece that would stay with me always.I recommend that you get on Proper_Noun and see the documentary about Proper_Noun D. Salinger. It will enrich your experience whether you see it before or after you read the book.Joanna Poppink, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun psychotherapistauthor: Proper_Noun Your Proper_Noun Proper_Noun recovering from your eating disorder
