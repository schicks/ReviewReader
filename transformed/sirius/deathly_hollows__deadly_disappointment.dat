33The last Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book is a severe disappointment on several levels. Superficially, the book is far too long. The most obvious examples are the several tedious passages of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun tabloid prose. Real tabloids are usually poor reads for obvious reasons and fictional tabloids are that much worse because even the pretext of reality cannot be maintained. While the tabloids are the worst example, the trio\'s wandering through the hinterland of Proper_Noun is not much better, making the reading wonder if this is not metaphorical for writer\'s own mental wanderings when writing the book. In previous books, the interludes between action sequences gave the Rowling an opportunity to create some depth to an otherwise one dimensional struggle between one dimensional middle class, predominantly white, good people, and one dimensional aristocratic, predominantly white bad people. She fails to create that depth in this book.Which leads us to the final, very predictable showdown between good Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and evil Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Unfortunately, the final confrontation leaves us wanting on several levels. Over the course of the larger story, we have found that Proper_Noun has made the classic literary trade of self-deformity for a rapid rise to power. Proper_Noun consuming drive for ultimate power blinds him to the tender mercies of love and the importance of friendship. Of course, his monstrous ego always forces him to discount his enemies as too weak and incompetent Proper_Noun Harry, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun These personal themes are set against a tableau of Proper_Noun more general campaign to subjugate or wipe out the Mudbloods and those pureblood\'s sympathetic to their plight as well. Of course Proper_Noun is, in part, if not entirely motivated, by his own self-loathing of his mediocre origins.This racial/ethnic motif runs strongly throughout the series with Proper_Noun and crew taking over the workings of government and the press to brings inquisitions, illegal imprisoning and even murders, but for all the obvious analogies with Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of the 1930\'s, such as a half-blood leading the purge of those less than pureblood echoing an Austrian of unassuming lineage leading campaign to establish Proper_Noun Proper_Noun race, the author never brings her villains to implement a final solution for the mudbloods. After all the posturing, threatening, and thuggery as well as the savage hatred Proper_Noun supposedly possesses for these undesirables as presented over several volumes, Rowling holds back at the end to show us a Proper_Noun whose bark is far worse than his bite.Which leads to the more general observation that the last book ultimately fails on the two horns of the portrayal of Proper_Noun weakness and his ultimate demise. Swords and sorcery tales often hinge upon the villain. Beowulf, The Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun The Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and even Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are some very notable examples. Authors need to make a decision in crafting their villain, either to make the villain distant and abstract or provide them real substance.Here, the author can not commit fully to one or the other, leaving us with a very one dimensional villain. Through several volumes, Proper_Noun is simply, "He who must not be named." a very bad wizard, who did very bad things. Slowly, we learn more about Proper_Noun his motivations and background, but the back-story is a little thin, and not quite convincing. Proper_Noun is apparently driven to crave power, and dominion, in part due to a sense of ancestral inadequacy and because he does not understand the value of love and friendship. In turn, his less than aristocratic background drives him to hate normal humans (mudbloods) and even mixed birth wizards.If Proper_Noun were to remain a faceless shadow, this thin character sketch would probably be enough, but Proper_Noun returns to the living to interact in a very tangible way with the other characters in the story. Becoming corporeal, one expects at least a two dimensional character to become part of the story. Unfortunately, Proper_Noun is as one-dimensional as possible. He believes he is the greatest wizard, most brilliant, visionary, etc. He hates Proper_Noun Proper_Noun especially because Proper_Noun survived Proper_Noun first attempt at killing him. Proper_Noun has survived because Proper_Noun underestimated him. Once Proper_Noun has achieved power he will kill or subjugate all the little people. Yes, Proper_Noun is evil. He is very evil. He does very bad things. Bad Proper_Noun one dimensional evil becomes dull. We never truly have any deep insight into Proper_Noun motivation other than he is a megalomaniac with low self-esteem concerning is humble beginnings, and his megalomania drives him to be evil. As result, Proper_Noun becomes dull as he is nothing but posturing, threatening and menace. Alive he is just as much a shadow as when he was dead. This is a major failure of the book as one can not build up the villain over several books to leave us with a one-note villain in the flesh. The reader expects a certain degree of infamy, bordering on charismatic greatness, and Proper_Noun simply does not deliver.This leads to Proper_Noun fundamental flaw. He does not understand love or friendship. Rowling makes this point several times throughout the books through several characters and incidents. Thus, with this buildup, one would expect Proper_Noun demise to be predicated on his fatal flaw. It is not. Unfortunately, this unexpected turn is not satisfying but appears very ad-hoc. Proper_Noun dies to fatal error in logic.It turns out that Proper_Noun is after an all powerful wand. However, he can not simply take the wand, but must defeat the current wand bearer or the person that killed the wand bearer, to be able to truly wield the power of the "super" wand. Through an error in logic, which I will not bore you with here, Proper_Noun kills the wrong man. Thus, the wand does not perform well for him. Furthermore, Proper_Noun must be careful, not to attempt to kill the rightful heir to wand with the wand itself. Otherwise, the wand may "turn" on Proper_Noun you might have guessed, Proper_Noun has bested the person that killed the original wand bearer, making him the rightful heir to the wand. Proper_Noun realizes the situation, and makes sure to face Proper_Noun in personal combat. Proper_Noun apparently entirely ignorant of the possibility of blow back from a wand that he has studied for years, blithely attacks Proper_Noun with super wand, even though Proper_Noun is clearly very confident to the point of bating him. As expected, the attack backfires and Proper_Noun drops dead on the spot. Stupid Proper_Noun Very stupid Proper_Noun demise is less than satisfying on several levels. First, his quick demise is rather anti-climatic. Don\'t we get even one evil wizard monologue? More importantly, Proper_Noun demise comes off as completely hackneyed. Rather than die due to something related to his fatal character flaw, he dies due to an error in logic. Which is all the odder because Proper_Noun was never characterized as dim, ignorant about the wand he sought for so long, or uninterested in the transmission of power. In fact, the point was explicitly made that when it came to power or items of power Proper_Noun was an expert. Thus, we are left with a villain whose demise was due to his own ignorance in the very area he was supposed to be renowned.Some may point out that this is a children\'s story and that some license should be granted to make the book digestible for children as well as not too traumatizing. However, our children, especially in today\'s culture are not na\xefve. Rowling should have thought more carefully, making Proper_Noun a villain worthy of a several thousand page epic.
