76***Note: Some broad, vaguely worded spoilers.****This is my least favorite Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book and it hurts to say so. I am a big fan, and have been since my older brother snuck me a copy (beneath my evangelical father\'s eyes) of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I am now all grown up and reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has been, in many ways, the mile marks of childhood for me. Let it be known that I don\'t give criticisms to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lightly, and that while a great deal of what I have to say is negative, it\'s my honest opinion, and not disgruntled fanmenship.I was at my local bookstore by 5 p.m. on Proper_Noun night and hit about the middle part of the line at the stroke of midnight. By 9 am on Proper_Noun I was finished, finished, finished...Despite my desperately anxious reading, many parts of the story dragged and it just didn\'t Proper_Noun like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Hogwarts took second stage next to the hectic, dangerous travels of our fine trio. When the pieces started falling (from the sky, as it were) into place there was a hurriedness, a randomness, a helter-skelter dissonance that bothered me like an itch. The ending tasted like raw sugar by the spoonfull--it left me with a stomach ache, and frankly, it read like poorly written fan-fiction.Rowling thrives on dialogue, indeed, Proper_Noun say she\'s one of the best writers of dialogue Proper_Noun ever read. Yet she doesn\'t capitalize on that large talent, instead relying on a tentative weakness: the contemplative Proper_Noun This was a grand mistake on her part.We all knew, coming into this book, that there would be huge revelations about our favorite sadistic teacher. Sadly those revelations were anti-climactic, seen through the Proper_Noun and in the middle of a large...er..."disturbance" in the continuing present of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun To remove Proper_Noun from the emotion of the present and put him in a calcified rendition of the past was jerky and rang false. In this sense there was no closure with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun never got his showdown; Proper_Noun never got his moment of revelation where he shivers in all his bitters. I missed that interaction very much. I was looking forward to it.That is the crux of my disappointment in the book: Proper_Noun isolation and silence. Proper_Noun has always, always relied upon a wide bevy of friends, even in Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun only marching to do battle alone at the emotional climax, wherein with a stroke of luck, he saves the day. In this book he remained continually withdrawn. I didn\'t laugh much, I didn\'t cry, and I felt trapped in a bubble throughout. I felt ostracized from this last book.Some more problems I had with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun individual deaths seemed to have no meaning in relation to the overall plot and character progression. In this way, they seemed gratuitous. Proper_Noun has said in interviews that she gave one character a reprieve and as a result gave two others the slash. I have an idea which character got the reprieve, and think, while I would have been devastated at that death, it would have been a better book with that death, and without the obvious two deaths she opted for. It would have had meaning to the overall arc and swing. As was, I blinked slightly at two of my favorite characters\' demise and plunged on without a tear.-Too condensed. I felt like I was in a college lecture: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 101. Interesting to the fan like me, but a novel isn\'t an encyclopedia, and shouldn\'t be made into one.Okay. Okay. Enough of the negatives. Let\'s face it: This is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun And all of us here love Proper_Noun What were the things I loved?-Just seeing my beloved characters. I missed them, and love them as if they were real. As long as they\'re around, even if they\'re not talking and even doing alot of dying, Proper_Noun happy.-Harry Proper_Noun all grown up. I kept wondering throughout the frantic travelings if Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had a moustacne? A beard? Ron did at one point. I wonder if Proper_Noun got all prickly.-Closure. Yeah. No more guessing. We know now. And the intricacies of plot were fantabulous. Thank you, Proper_Noun the second to the last chapter I swallowed hard. The last page! I saw Proper_Noun exit the pages before my eyes, walk through an open door. I felt like my childhood had just waved goodbye and maybe it just did.Goodbye Proper_Noun Proper_Noun We will all miss you!
