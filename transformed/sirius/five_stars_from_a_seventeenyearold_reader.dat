7I checked out the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books out of curiosity when I heard that even adults were said to love them. I was hooked after the first one and the three Proper_Noun books have been the best, most relaxing, and fun reading Proper_Noun done in a long time. If a high-schooler can appreciate Proper_Noun Proper_Noun anyone can. I do think, however, that "magic" should be discussed with child readers so that they have a realistic perspective on the world around them. The occult scene in our world is nowhere near as benign as the environment at Proper_Noun and children enamored with the magical realm in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun need to understand that.
