14This is a fantastic story for literally any age! Be sure to read the books in order, as the author truly uses detail to enhance the magic of the tale. Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Proper_Noun - Proper_Noun wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a courageous young boy. At the age of 11, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun had to step up to his place of honor and danger in a world he never knew existed. In his 2nd year at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was back in the thick of adventure while he dealt with a new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun teacher as well as a few old nemeses from book 1. Proper_Noun not only showed a bit more of his own courage and ability while at the same time fighting a few of his own fears. This tense theme continued into the 3rd book, where Proper_Noun has much more to contend with than his own past. You will be amazed at the villains and heroes in this one - the twists and turns had me reading from cover to cover more than once! The climax has a gripping level of suspense so you CAN\'T put it down! And, once more, wise old Dumbeldor shows what it really means to be a wizard and a hero as he helps Proper_Noun understand a bit more of himself! (Please, Proper_Noun don\'t ever lose this! His wisdom makes us all think a bit more about ourselves too!) I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thought out story as well as a good time. Yes, it is a book targeted for children, but as an adult I can even say that I sat, after reading it, just thinking. My mind couldn\'t seem to pull itself out of the captivating world of Proper_Noun and I had that warm feeling that you get when the good guys win over the bad ones, and you know the world is safe until the next adventure. I can\'t help it. I like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and other wide epics that tell a good myth. Although I didn\'t start reading fantasy until after I went to college, I have become a huge fan over the years. Rowling creates a tight, quick paced story that keeps you reading \'till the end, much like Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun great authors)! She has really added a worthwhile series to a sometimes forgotten genera. I find myself caught up in the characters and story. My only dislike for the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series is that it is slated to last only 7 books!
