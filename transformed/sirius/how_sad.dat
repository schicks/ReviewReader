8I\'ve been a die-hard Proper_Noun Proper_Noun fan for years now, still am, and the anticipation of this final book was unlike anything I had ever witnessed. I was over the moon with excitement. Pottermania was more than just colorful costumes, or wand-waving, or playing quidditch in your backyard. The story had an elemental substance, a cross-cultural testament to true living. The magic was greater than the sum of its parts. How can something like that not end on a high note? The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the last act of one of the most celebrated sagas of our generation, concludes not as the triumph it could have been but as an embarrassing, hollow groan. JK Proper_Noun was either incapable or unwilling to deliver an Proper_Noun novel worthy of her prior standards.Unforgivable Plot Proper_Noun fantasy stories have plot holes to a degree, and the previous Proper_Noun books are Proper_Noun exception. It all comes down to whether or not the story allows for a reasonable suspension of belief within the context of the created world. The disparities in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun range from forgivable to lazy to incompetent, and it shows a monumental lack of care when your easiest-to-fix plot problems somehow survive all manuscript revisions. It\'s a screw-you to devoted readers.The top 3 offenses: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lore and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It\'s unbeatable unless it\'s not Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or it\'s unbeatable unless its allegiance has been transferred to another Proper_Noun Proper_Noun (2) The name taboo. So the ministry can track anyone anywhere in seconds if they say a certain word? Why not put taboos on a whole host of words? This one isn\'t even worth trying to explain away. It was a cheap plot trick in order to get Proper_Noun captured at just the right moment. (3) Proper_Noun blood protection. According to Proper_Noun at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun will not be harmed as long as Proper_Noun lives because of the blood infusion thing from back in book 4. Essentially, there\'s Proper_Noun risk to Proper_Noun in the final battle. Proper_Noun risk = Proper_Noun dramatic tension. And that\'s not even the end of it. By simply being present at the finale, Proper_Noun shields his friends from harm too.Runner-up offenses: The slipshod introduction of the Proper_Noun the sorting hat as a replicator of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun convenient 180 on what happens when a secret keeper dies, Proper_Noun summoning Proper_Noun for Dummies out of the headmaster\'s office, why Proper_Noun never mentioned the lost diadem to Proper_Noun why nobody ever noticed Proper_Noun patronus, how house elves can be summoned instantaneously to and from any location regardless of magical protections, and coincidental close calls everywhere--breaking into the ministry, breaking into Proper_Noun locating horcruxes, escaping from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are successful because of timely dumb luck.Character Inconsistencies.You can pair this one with plot because radical changes in character were likely needed to smooth over the worst of the story problems. For example, there\'s Proper_Noun believable reason for why Proper_Noun would open his mind up to Proper_Noun again after he intentionally closed it in the last book. But if he didn\'t, then Proper_Noun wouldn\'t have received the vital information he needed to advance. Also, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems to have taken a nose dive since we last saw him in book 5. It\'s a good thing though because Proper_Noun and team wouldn\'t have had a chance in hell otherwise Proper_Noun above, re: luck). By the end it was like Proper_Noun had wandered over into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. "Gaaahhhhh! I would\'ve gotten away with it too, if it weren\'t for you kids!"And then there\'s Proper_Noun casting unforgivable curses. This isn\'t the same Proper_Noun as from book 5 when he attempts the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in a fit of rage against Proper_Noun after she murders his godfather. There he was like a child mishandling his dad\'s rifle. This time around Proper_Noun shows Proper_Noun trepidation. He finds them convenient to get what he needs--no, no, no! That\'s what the bad guys do!Other inconsistencies: Proper_Noun has a sordid past, but that\'s not as disconcerting as the present-day Proper_Noun being revealed as a manipulative jerk. Snape drops a few Proper_Noun points by never putting 2 and 2 together regarding Proper_Noun horcruxes. Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun they even an item? Proper_Noun seems less assertive which is characteristically backwards for her. Proper_Noun turns out okay though. Heck he might even be the only main character to show consistent, believable growth.Hogwarts. Or lack thereof.Plot and character account for the majority of problems in Proper_Noun and had they been fixed, I think the the whole thing might have been adequate. Nevertheless, Proper_Noun took a risk by not having Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun attend their 7th year at Proper_Noun It was never really a choice given the narrative starting point of Proper_Noun and it\'s difficult to imagine the trio hunting Proper_Noun while being hunted by Proper_Noun and the ministry all while studying for their Proper_Noun I think book 6 and maybe book 5 would have played out differently had this alternate universe occurred. In hindsight, removing Proper_Noun as the central setting of Proper_Noun gutted the story of its essential awe and heart. The school is as much a character in Proper_Noun as are its inhabitants.---This is my third reading of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I read it once when it came out in 2007, once soon after in order to process the train wreck I had just read, and once more this year, seven years on. My hope was that time would allow me to give an honest review of a convoluted book so blindly adored by the world, and it has. Proper_Noun is even worse than I remember. I love the world of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and this final installment is an insult to thinking fans everywhere who respect the whole as more than mere stories for children.
