96Having been a fan of the books since 1999, I was anxiously awaiting this final chapter. However, I was left disappointed. It is by no means a bad book, but simply not everything I hoped it would and could be.***Spoilers Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has been trying to tie up all the threads of the preceding books since a rather long and awkward passage of exposition in books 5 and 6, and it does little more than slow down the books. In this book we get loads of expository reasoning that tries to pull together disparate plot elements. It merely serves to halt the action and bore the average reader. Proper_Noun is at her best when she is writing dynamic action scenes, producing fantastical settings or creating interesting characters. Too late in the book she introduces the concept of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and tries to join it to the plot of the Proper_Noun It seems forced and unnecessary. The Proper_Noun invention from the last book was quite enough of a plot to carry the reader through this final installment. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lend nothing to the story, and Proper_Noun does little with it in the plot. There is no satisfactory explanation as to the Proper_Noun ring being a Proper_Noun and a Proper_Noun and why Proper_Noun would not have known it was. And frankly, I didn\'t care. I was waiting for the final showdown between him and Proper_Noun anyway. Why introduce the whole robbing Proper_Noun grave for a wand plot? It went nowhere and just held things up a bit more.Another major problem in the book, as has been noted with previous books, is Proper_Noun himself. I was willing to put up with his uselessness in past books due to his age, but by this time I expected him to step up and prove himself. Instead, we get more petulance, whining and dithering. Hermione is smarter than he is, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are braver, and Proper_Noun has to rely on outside help from a variety of sources Proper_Noun ex machina like Proper_Noun from book 2, his Proper_Noun Proper_Noun in every book, and even Proper_Noun in this book) to achieve his goals. It\'s either this, dumb luck or coincidence that helps him locate the Proper_Noun seldom perseverance or intelligence. The final battle with Proper_Noun finds him again relatively passive, relying on his mother\'s protective charm and another coincidence to help him defeat Proper_Noun Mrs. Weasley proves far more engaging in her face-off with Proper_Noun By page 450 I actively disliked Proper_Noun which is a major problem since he\'s supposed to be the hero. He does redeem himself a bit in the later chapters, but it would have been far better if he had displayed more strength and intelligence earlier in the book.I also didn\'t like the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun plot rip-off with the trio of friends taking turns carrying the one Proper_Noun around their necks even though it affects their moods. Again, no satisfactory explanation is given as to why it can\'t simply be carried harmlessly in a pocket or bag. If this was Proper_Noun idea of homage, it missed the mark. Further, I could have easily lived without the character assassination of Proper_Noun Was it really necessary, and again, where did it lead?Having said this, there were a lot of good, well written scenes in the book, especially the Proper_Noun infiltration, and the final battle at Proper_Noun The book simply needed to be pared down to a reasonable length by a good editor who could keep the plot moving forward without clunky pauses to overexplain an overplotted narrative. As to the violence and dark tone of the book which some readers object to, I had no problem with it. It fit perfectly with where the story has been headed since the end of Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun and was to be expected. It would have been an unrealistic expectation to think that Proper_Noun could be defeated without losses on both sides. Overall then, a decent read, just a disappointing conclusion to a great book series. 3 1/2 stars out of 5
