139This 17-disc audio version of the final Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book is a worthy way to experience the story without reading it. It features the rich baritone of narrator Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who tells the tale with just the right understated touch, supplying all of the characters\' voices.As for Proper_Noun accent, it\'s appropriately British but not at all too thick. Each word is clear and easy to understand. If you\'ve bought any of the earlier Proper_Noun audio Proper_Noun you know what to expect: Proper_Noun narrated all of those, too.By the way, note that this is an UNABRIDGED audio book. Listening to it all takes 21 hours!The story is dark, and too violent for younger kids, but overall one of the best in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series. Nothing seems forced or thrown together. Author Proper_Noun Rowling wraps up her many plot points and reveals the fates of her characters in ways that almost always surprise you, but afterward seem inevitable.And how she does it is so inventive! Many throwaway moments and whispered remarks from earlier books foreshadow what happens here, and devices that had little importance before, such as Proper_Noun flying motorcycle, now play key roles. While creating yet another gripping tale, the author also ties her entire epic together with the skill of a true literary master. As a writer myself, I really admire her skill. (Last time I checked, Rowling was outselling me by about, oh, a billion to one.)In addition, the book treats its title character with the complexity he deserves. It portrays the (now) young man as disillusioned, full of doubt, overwhelmed -- a tortured soul who, though a responsible leader in an all-out war, often seems to yearn to do nothing more than sweet-talk Proper_Noun Proper_Noun should know, however, that this one is a real creepfest, with the most explicitly violent scenes of any book in the series. It\'s way too brutal for grade schoolers. Also, unlike the earlier Proper_Noun tales, the far-reaching vocabulary requires about a 6th-grade education.
