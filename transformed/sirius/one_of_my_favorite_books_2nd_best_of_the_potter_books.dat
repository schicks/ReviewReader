120For my money, though I like the first two Proper_Noun books, this is where Proper_Noun struck gold. I started reading the series in late 1999 or early 2000, well before Proper_Noun came out, and when I finished the three books that at that Proper_Noun were out, I thought Proper_Noun was not only easily the best of three, but one of the best books I had read in a long time. The storyline is easily the strongest of the first three installments, and for once Proper_Noun is not the main villain driving the plot, but, so it is thought, a renegade supporter of his who murdered 13 people with a single curse.In AZKABAN, we learn an escaped criminal from the wizard prison Proper_Noun by the name of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is out on the lam looking for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun was once a vehement supporter for Proper_Noun and now Proper_Noun is gunning to finish off the job by murdering Proper_Noun a task he had tried to do several years ago. Not only that, Proper_Noun learns during the course of the plot that Proper_Noun was Proper_Noun best friend, along with the new defense against the dark arts teacher, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun We get to learn who Proper_Noun really is (another instant of an character mentioned in passing on the first two novels who is hugely important here). Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun godfather, and yet he betrayed the Proper_Noun makes Proper_Noun so interesting is you really get to learn about the relationships between Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun These five characters, and their relationships with one another, are huge portions of the foundation on which Proper_Noun built her series. You need a clear understanding of these characters to fully experience Proper_Noun series, and it is thru these characters that this book, and the series itself, is as rich as it is. The fact no one knew that the three characters were unregistered animagus to help Proper_Noun cope with his condition was pretty cool.For once, Proper_Noun introduces a new magical artifiact called the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which she uncharacteristically fully explains by the end of the novel. It was made by Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun which are the nicknames of Proper_Noun and his crew. The map shows you the location of every one on the Proper_Noun grounds, a tremendously useful item, supplied, appropriately enough, by those masters of mischief, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun great new bit of magic in the Proper_Noun is the Proper_Noun a magical spell that will help fight back the dementors and fear, a very advanced piece of magic for third years. It is also very touching to know why Proper_Noun patronus is a stag, as that is what his father transformed into.There are also other memorable scenes and events. You get Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun etc. The climax of the novel is great, but for me, it\'s that Proper_Noun when Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are all in that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and you finally get to learn a lot of key information about Proper_Noun past.Ironically enough, though I have long held the opinion this is the best Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of them all (not including Proper_Noun 7), this Proper_Noun has the worst movie adaptation, BECAUSE they don\'t fully establish all the different relationships between the four, or even explain the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun myself, this is easily my favorite of the Proper_Noun novels, or was until Proper_Noun Proper_Noun came out. Still, I have had a great history with this book, and probably reread this more than all the other Proper_Noun books. This is the second best Proper_Noun book.These are my order of Proper_Noun books by preference:Deathly Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun rank them both the same)Half-Blood Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun
