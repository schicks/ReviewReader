15I tried to read this Proper_Noun with as non-prejudicial an eye as I could possibly read. Honestly. I adored her first three books, absolutely hated her work from Proper_Noun 4 through 6 and I really hoped that this would be better.To be fair to Proper_Noun she did tie up many loose ends from the earlier books, and actually provided a decent finish to the series that seemed to satisfy all parties. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun died, and Proper_Noun and his friends survive mostly unscathed.However, the sins of her previous work came back to haunt this Proper_Noun too, as many of the loose ends created were unnecessary, and resulted in another Proper_Noun of gargantuan proportions that really meandered to nowhere too often, and could not be read by itself Proper_Noun hallmark of bad series writing).The book, started badly with a needless description of Proper_Noun activities, but Proper_Noun redeemed herself with a thrilling description of a chase from Proper_Noun house to Tonk\'s. From then on it was largely about Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun wandering about the countryside of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun looking for Proper_Noun and trying not to get killed. It culminates in a thrilling standoff at Proper_Noun death of many characters we have known to love and finally the death of Proper_Noun himself.But this Proper_Noun felt as bad as the rest for me. For one, her woeful underutilisation of characters made it a very one dimensional story of the three kids vs. Voldemort, and everything else it seemed was almost meaningless. Characters apart from Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun seemed to just be bit-players of almost ridiculously insignificant roles (Contrast this with the way Proper_Noun used his characters in the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun The plot, characterisations, and roles each of the protagonists played was hilariously simplistic, to the point of absurdity and with all the interesting characters all dead by the time this Proper_Noun was released, it meant that she had to devise very convoluted means to still keep them relevant and thus the story, interesting (including a meeting with a very deceased Proper_Noun and a flayed baby Proper_Noun wish I was making this up) at Proper_Noun Proper_Noun station).After portraying Proper_Noun as a trusting old fool who was probably senile and/or insane upto and including Proper_Noun 6, Proper_Noun in her attempt to round out his character better just ended up making him appear like a conniving, senile, insane trusting old fool at the end of this book.What was perhaps most perplexing was Proper_Noun seemed to have a penchant for killing off characters for no apparent reason in duels and conflicts that really go nowhere. After making readers feel for and emotionally reach out to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and (to a lesser extent) Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun she killed them off in almost cavalier fashion, like they were just people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They could have been Proper_Noun dead parents for all the role they played in this last book.Rowling\'s definition of a work for young adults seems to rely exclusively on introducing copious amounts of death and lots of Proper_Noun Her work has all the sophistry of a childrens\' Proper_Noun and unintentionally hilarious accounts of teenage romance and angst Proper_Noun makes one cast a doubt whether Proper_Noun actually went through a normal teenage life), resulting in a piece of work that is too childish, one-dimensional and simple for grown-ups, and too unpleasant for children. As I asked before, could we have the \'Prisoner of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun back, please?
