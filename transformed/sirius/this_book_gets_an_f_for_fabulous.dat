10I love reading, so of course you, Proper_Noun critical reviewer who is trying to decide whether or not to buy this book, is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by that first line. Perhaps this will persuade you. I read Proper_Noun first chapter of this book to my five-year old sister. She does not share my passion for Proper_Noun written word, nor does she appreciate fantasy-type games or TV shows.

If it could pull in my sister, and immerse her into Proper_Noun world so thouroughly that she would turn Proper_Noun her friend, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun then I think this book is truly a marvel.
