16As this is the last book in the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series, where all of the loose ends are supposed to be tied up and all of the pieces come together, there was certainly potential for the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to be something of a disappointment. I hate to say it, but for the most part, that\'s exactly what it is. The pacing is uneven, there were far too many narrow escapes, and too many plot twists that were more than just a little convenient. However, my biggest complaint is that there was far too much story before the final battle Proper_Noun fair amount of it unnecessary), and not enough after.J. K. Rowling has said that there will likely be no more Proper_Noun Proper_Noun stories. That\'s unfortunate, because I don\'t believe Proper_Noun entire story has been told. In many ways, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun saga isn\'t all that different from another of my favorite books, The Proper_Noun Of The Proper_Noun In that story, an unlikely hero takes on a seemingly impossible task, walking into the unknown and facing almost certain death, driven on by his strength of will, the fear of failure (knowing how those he loves will suffer), and aided only by the love and support of his friends.Sound familiar?But Frodo\'s story didn\'t end with the destruction of the ring and the downfall of Proper_Noun Nor did it end with the crowning of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun It ended as he sailed from the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun but only after he had returned to the Proper_Noun and had witnessed first hand the fruits of his labors: the intellectual and emotional growth of his friends (particularly Proper_Noun and the restoration of the their peaceful life in the Proper_Noun suppose it\'s easy to view Proper_Noun story as the tale of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the boy who stood tall and faced the power of dark magic to defeat the evil Proper_Noun Proper_Noun But the truth is, this is a love story. Or more precisely, a story of love. It was his mother\'s love that had protected him as an infant, and to a lesser extant had helped protect him at the Proper_Noun It was the love of his friends and surrogate family that supported him as the evil threat grew. It was the love he shared with Proper_Noun that helped to keep him going. And it was his love for all of them and his desire to save them that enabled him to decide, finally, to sacrifice himself. We watched as he was pushed to the limits of suffering and despair. There\'s no reason to believe that he wouldn\'t emerge from his ordeal with a tortured soul and, perhaps, even a fractured mind, and that it would take as much love, if not more, from his friends to help him recover.But we don\'t get to see any of that. Instead, there\'s a classic "...and they all lived happily ever after" epilogue, where we see Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun married with kids and a car and a house, probably even a mortgage and a yard full of bicycles and broomsticks, maybe a cat, etc. The point, of course, is that Proper_Noun healing, and that of his friends, is every bit as much an important part of his story. It certainly is to all of us who\'ve taken this journey with him.I had just finished rereading the first six books before I tackled this one, so I guess I half expected there to be the same level of charm and humor that has been present throughout the series. Granted, it was inevitable that this would be a very dark tale. It just would have been nice if some of that feeling could have been recaptured at the end of the story, as it was one of the things that had made the series so appealing in the first place. (There were one or two notable exception; the exchange between Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun on his birthday, and her statement about the silver lining, really knocked me out.)I hope Proper_Noun Rowling reconsiders her plans regarding the series. Not to tell the rest of Proper_Noun story is, I believe, a huge disservice to her fans, her characters, and to the wonderful magical world she\'s created.
