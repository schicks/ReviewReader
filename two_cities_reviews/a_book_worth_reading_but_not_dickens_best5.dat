One of only two "historical" fictions by Dickens, A TALE OF TWO CITIES has a different flavor than his other major works.  There is less focus on personal human emotion than in\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Oliver-Twist/dp/0486424537">Oliver Twist</a>\xa0or\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/David-Copperfield/dp/0140439447">David Copperfield</a>, and more of a broad examination of humanity as a group.  The characters themselves, with the exception of Sydney Carton and Madame Defarge, are mostly forgettable, another striking difference from other Dickens work. The humorous wit that you might expect is also largely missing in this book.  The writing is more concise and direct, lacking the overly-long, flowing sentences found in his character-driven dramas.  All of that being said, A TALE OF TWO CITIES is still a powerful and well-written book that is just different from what you might expect.  It is certainly still worth your time.The horrific portrayal of the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution gives this otherwise light-hearted book plenty of gravity.  Dickens\' characterizations of mad revolutionaries like "The Vengeance" and out-of-control mobs eager for violence present an ugly picture of humanity at its worst.  Within this terrible setting the characters from A TALE OF TWO CITIES face real danger in the second half of the book, where one is identified as a member of the previous aristocracy and is targeted for a date with La Guillotine. The emotional roller-coaster that follows his family trying to secure his release provides the only real drama of the story.  All in all, this is a book worth reading, but not Dickens\' best.  For that, I would suggest Oliver Twist.This\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Kindle-version/dp/B00M12LARC">Kindle version</a>\xa0that I read was exellent. No typos or other problems, and the illustrations were small but visible.
