This is no doubt an excellent book, and the last 100 pages or so will simply dazzle you.  As you read, you will feel the terror that accompanied the French Revolution, and understand the forces that led to the upheaval  and chaos.  I felt that Dickens\' portrayal of the politics was suprisingly  evenhanded.  Dickens shows flashes of brilliant prose throughout, and his  character development is simply unparalleled.  Unfortunately, there are  places where the story drags, and while some of these "dead  spots" make sense later, many do not.  This was the only flaw, and for  this reason I gave this otherwise outstanding book only 4 stars.
