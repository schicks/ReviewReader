After a long and undeserved imprisonment in France, Doctor Manette is released to the care of his daughter, Lucie, who had previously thought him dead, and as a result of their removal to England they meet Jarvis Lorry, Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, three men that will feature largely in the story of their lives, and in the events that draw them back to France, as well as those that occur during the Revolution going on there at the time. This story largely centers around Lucie, and all the adoring men in her life. She is such an angelic, perfect creature that there doesn\u2019t seem to be much to her, other than her radiance and beauty, but I think the understanding, caring way she handled Sydney Carton\u2019s confession gave her a bit more depth and I almost thought her deserving of his deep regard. For me, Sydney Carton is by far and away the most interesting character in this story. He is a brooding man, resigned to his own unhappiness, in love with a woman he can never have, and willing to give her everything (even his life) if she should ever have need of it. Plus, the scene at the end with the young seamstress is so beautiful! I\u2019m glad all his efforts were recognized for what they were worth in the end.This Top Five Classics Edition is organized for optimum maneuverability, is prettily arranged, very readable, and includes illustrations by Hablot K. Browne and Frederick Barnard (combining the illustrations from their various editions). A great reading copy for a great price!
