A Tale of Two Cities paints a beautiful while dark story of the French Revolution and how it affects an English family.  It is, by all standards, a classic.  Yet, if you decide to read it and are younger than a high school senior, I suggest reading it with a good dictionary by your side.  It is written in the English of over one-hundred years ago and so I would also recommend a version that includes notes on what certain phrases mean as well as a guide to the allusions used in the story.  I am not recommending the abridged version, though.  Reading it as it was written gives a much different experience that seems more genuine.  The copy of the novel that I read was published by Pocket Books and includes explanatory notes and more which I found very helpful. As I read I saw examples where Dickens (the author), implied satirical messages and themes relevant to the time when the book was written.  Then, the situation in England resembled pre-Revolution France.  Also, 1848, was known as the "Year of Revolutions".  He may have been trying to discourage revolution and encourage solutions through political change, not violence.  Dickens also implied, through his words, that a revolution could happen anywhere, even in England.  He encouraged his message frequently but it never got old and wasn\'t monotonous.  By using a variety of different situations, Dickens kept his message in the reader\'s mind.  For example, at a burial of a spy in England, a mob forms and turns the burial into show of irreverent mourning and violence.  He is implying that under the right conditions any group of people can turn into a violent mob.  He also writes that history will repeat itself under the same circumstances.  This message would have been very pertinent at the time.  These messages about the state and flaws of society were frequent but were well integrated into the story.  Many were fun to read due to Dickens\' good use of satire and humor. One complaint that many historians, literary critics, and others have had about A Tale of Two Cities is that the characters and depiction of the social classes are too unrealistic.  I, too, thought that some of the characters were somewhat unrealistic, yet I don\'t believe that Dickens made them that way without reason.  One example is in a moment with a member the French aristocracy.  While riding at breakneck speed through downtown Paris, this noble\'s carriage hits and kills a child.  In response, he turns to the grieving father and coolly tosses him a gold piece and drives off.  I saw this action as very unrealistic, but this isn\'t supposed to be literal.  This noble\'s action is part of his characterization that is just supposed to show that he is very cold.  It is also supposed to symbolize the oppression of the peasants by the aristocracy.  The lower class had been oppressed for so long and Dickens sums up their oppression through this one noble\'s action.  Still, some of the characters\' actions are unrealistic.  After a condemned man is read his condemning sentence, he is perfectly composed and shows no signs of anxiety or emotion but love for his wife.  There is no way that any human could be unafraid after that.  Despite some unrealistic moments in Dickens characters, his description of the classes and their struggles is excellent.  This is probably because of his experience.  As a boy, Dickens was a peasant, which explains why his descriptions of peasant life and their strife are so detailed.  I personally found Dickens\' characters very appealing and his description of French society very enthralling. If you are unsure if you want to read this book, my advice to you would be: definitely read it.  Dickens creates a capturing world with a deep plot, exquisite use of imagery, and striking characters, all in one of the most exciting times in history.  Pick it up and you won\'t regret it.
