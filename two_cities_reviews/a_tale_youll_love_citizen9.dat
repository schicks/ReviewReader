Having read Les Miserables and the Scarlet Pimpernel, I thought I must read this one.  Although by far I enjoyed Les Mis much more, this book gives an objective view.  Dickens describes both the sufferings of the poor before the revolution and the injustice done to the nobility under the Republic.  Dickens\' writing style is fascinating, I loved it.  Yes, it\'s difficult and tedious; I\'m a bit slow myself but enjoyed it far too much to give it up.  The descriptions of the misery of the peasants, the attack on the Bastille, the murder of the nobles, the thirst for revenge, are all painfully expressive.  Dickens often uses dark humour and irony, it makes it all funny and painfull at once: "who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack." What a picture!But it is mainly a story of love, revenge and self-sacrifice rather than a commentary on the revolution.  Dr. Mannette is released after being unjustly imprisoned for 18 years, and he finds he has a perfect angelic little daughter, Lucie.  Charles Darnay is a young, dashing, but good French aristocrat who reliquished his title in France, and is exiled in England.  Sydney Carton, the "idlest and most unpromising of men," has become one of my favorites in literature.  He\'s an unhappy alchoholic, who appears incapable of achieving anything good.  I liked him from the first, because he didn\'t like Darnay much and, neither did I!  Carton is in love with Lucie, unrequitedly.  Lucie marries Darnay.  Darnay\'s antipathy towards Carton becomes of major significance at the end.  As the French Revolution erupts in France, duty calls Darnay back to Paris, where he is captured and tried.  The ending is the grandest I have ever read; poignant, tearful, prophetic, bittersweet.  It takes days to recover!  It ends in perhaps the most unselfish, heroic of sacrifices in fiction.  With Dickens\' beautiful use of prose this becomes truly unforgettable.  I recommend it for everyone, young and old, as long as you can handle the language.  I can\'t believe I waited this long to read it!
