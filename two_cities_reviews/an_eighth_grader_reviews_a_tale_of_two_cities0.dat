This book is incredible. I read it last year (in eighth grade), and I love it. I love Charles Dickens\' language and style. Whoever is reading this may have little or no respect for my opinions, thinking that I am to young to  comprehend the greatness of the plot and language, and I admit that I  probably do not completely appreciate this classic piece of literature. I  do read above a 12th grade level, although that doesn\'t count for a whole  lot. It took me a while to get into this book. In fact, I dreaded reading  it for a long time. But nearer to the end, I was drawn in by the poignant  figure of a jackal, Sydney Carton. In his story I became enthralled with  this book, especially his pitiful life. After I read and cried at Carton\'s  transformation from an ignoble jackal to the noblest of persons, I was able  to look back over the parts of the book that I had not appreciated, and  realize how truly awesome they are. I learned to appreciate all of the  characters, from Lucy Manette to Madame Defarge. I also was affected by all  of the symbolism involved with both the French Revolution, and the nature  of sinful man, no matter what the time or place. My pitiful review could  never do justice to this great book, please don\'t be discouraged by my  inability.
