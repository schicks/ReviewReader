A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a captivating novel that takes readers back to a time of turmoil and distress in both France and England before and during the French Revolution. From the beginning, Dickens catches the reader\'s attention with the strange and mysterious list of dualities that initially seem to make no sense. Yet as the story progresses, this and other vague ideas begin to clear, and develop into a clear plot. This plot shows the hatred between the peasants and the nobles of France, without having to explain it himself.Dickens is able to create a plot around this period of time in a way that does not make it seem like a documentary that details the events of the Revolution. Instead, he integrates static and dynamic characters into the novel, each with their own significance and purpose. Although these are not typical people of the time period, they are purposely used to embody different aspects of life. Madame Defarge for instance, is portrayed as a bloodthirsty and heartless revolutionary, who is only concerned with the death of the aristocracy. By creating a character with these values, Dickens can show the discord between the peasantry and the aristocracy through the words and actions of Madame Defarge. The incorporation of fictional character and historical events makes for an interesting and some-what factual novel.By analyzing this novel, one can see Dickens use of symbols and other literary devices to convey information to reader. For example, the broken wine cask in the poor streets of a French town was a symbolic scene in foreshadowing the rising of the peasants against the nobles. This and other literary devices give subtle hints of what is to come in the novel. Though it may not come to ones attention immediately, carefully looking for these devices helps to clarify the story and well as foreshadow the future chapters of the novel.This novel is something that could and should be read by anyone looking for an interesting spin on history. Given that it will take longer for some to understand then others, by reading carefully, it can be a very enjoyable novel. Charles Dickens novel A Tale of Two Cities is definitely a novel worth taking a look at.
