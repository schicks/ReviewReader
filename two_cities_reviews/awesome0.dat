I had a bad experience with Dickens. 2 years ago I tried reading Oliver Twist, after seeing the Disney movie, but after going through 3 chapters that took up 40 pages each - but consisted of only 2 paragraphs each, just for Oliver to be born and named, I gave up.  Now I\'m in 8th grade and as a language arts assignment, we were to read a Dickens novel.  It was either A Tale of Two Cities or Great Expectations.  I saw the Wishbone summary of A Tale of Two Cities and thought it had a nice plot but was dreading going through Dickens\'s lllooooonnnggg drones.This time however, Dickens secured my interest with the ideal beginning of "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . ." I was immediately drawn into the story of mystery and splendor.  The characters didn\'t suddenly multiply like they did before and I got to understand each and every one - from pretty Lucie Manette to the harsh Monseigneur the Marquis.Dickens\'s drifting speeches improved as well: turning out to be quite dramatic and interesting.  Maybe the book could have been a lot shorter - but it gives you something to think on.  And it\'s definitely better than just having an author say, "okay, this is the story and that\'s the end." Instead, he gives you a suspensful novel that you are never bored with.  You have to carefully follow the story and see how the threads tie together in the end.. . . Prepare to be amazed!
