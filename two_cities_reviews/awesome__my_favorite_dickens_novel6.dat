I like all of Dicken\'s work because of his ability to bring a place and period to life as well as his gift for creating round characters that seem like real people you can reach out and touch.  This novel certainly represents these qualities, but has a dark quality with no type of comic relief.  It is intense and it captures the psychological and emotional climate of the the French revolution in a visceral way.This novel which parallels the rise of the French revolution, compares and contrasts life in two cities Paris and London.  It also develops a very intricate plot that is difficult to follow if one does not read steadily.  In other words, it\'s not a light plot that you can set down for a few days and pick back up.  On the other hand, it\'s extremely engaging and you won\'t want to put it down.When I read it, I actually bought the Cliff\'s notes because I needed to set the book down for a few days at a time.  When I picked it up again, I found the Cliff\'s notes useful to help me engage again without a lot of looking back through the book for all the twists and turns in the plot and lives of the characters.This is a great novel in every respect, but it is not a happy one.  It captures the harsh reality of the French Revolution in deep way.  If you are studying the French Revolution, I would say it\'s a must read to truly get the spirit of what was going on.  I don\'t believe history books can do it justice, you need the inside view which this provides.Lastly, if you are simply enjoy a good story, you will like this.  Don\'t expect a "everyone lived happily ever" type ending, however.  This is heavy stuff, almost in the spirit of a Russian existentialist novel.
