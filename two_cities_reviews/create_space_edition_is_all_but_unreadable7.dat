The edition published by "Create Space..." is almost unreadable.  While the book is an oversized paperback, the font size is small, and the line spacing between lines is crowded.  The formatting of the chapters &amp; etc can only be described as strange:  sort of like what would happen if you put the entire Dickens text through Microsoft Word but did not spend time on centering chapter names &amp; etc.
