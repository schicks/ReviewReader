This electronic edition of the classic Dickens text is, by far, the best available in this price range. Several I looked at were clearly nothing more than reissues of the gutenberg.org text with the licensing information removed, and included the oddities of that version. One of these, which is visible from the start, is the choice of breaking the opening paragraph of the novel into lines as if it were verse. Fortunately, the publishers of this edition avoided this pitfall and the formatting is consistent and correct throughout. In addition, the illustrations are excellent and contribute to the overall polish of the text. If looking for a low-cost Tale of Two Cities do not hesitate to select this one.
