I purchased this because it advertised a free audiobook link. My intention was to listen to it on my Kindle on a 16 hour upcoming road trip. Once I received the book, it was very difficult to find the free audiobook link and that was only after 30 minutes of assistance from Amazon customer support. Once the link was located, customer support finally figured out that it could only be downloaded and listened to on a PC/MAC. I attempted to do this, the link came back as "Archive Error".While the cost was only $0.99, the aggravation suffered was at least $19.99.I suggest the product description be expanded to fully explain what the "free audiobook link" is and how it works.
