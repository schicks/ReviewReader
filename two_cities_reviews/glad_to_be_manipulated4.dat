Some complain that Dickens is overdone, but sometimes it\'s just a joy to go along for the long ride, with swoops and dips and long trailings out of ideas. Sure we\'re manipulated, and yes, the characters are types, but with its political content, A TALE OF TWO CITIES explores the personal aspects of national identity and the conflicts of war. Just as we hope, human integrity can transcend national pettiness and individual evil. Whew, what a relief! That\'s the appeal of Dickens.
