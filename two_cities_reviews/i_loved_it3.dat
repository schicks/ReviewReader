I just finished reading this book in my 9th grade Honors english class, and I have to say that I loved it! It was terribly boring at first--very hard reading! And Dickens IS VERY wordy; or, as my English teacher says, he  likes to make his point and than slap you in the face with it several times  until you get the point! Aside from that however, I really enjoyed the  story. I laughed with my friends over the mini battle between Madame  Defarge and Miss Pross, and cried with them at Sydney Carton\'s courage(he  made Charles Darnay look meaningless). Although this classic story is by  far one of the best I\'ve ever read (Black Beauty is THE best), I don\'t  think I could have enjoyed it nearly as much without my wonderful English  teacher explaining every "difficult" section-- and pointing out  the humor that Dickens uses, and which many overlook. To fully enjoy this  book, you have to read "between the lines", but if you have the  patience to do this, I gaurentee you will love this book as much as I do!
