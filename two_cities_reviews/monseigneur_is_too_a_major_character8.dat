I was prompted to write this review for a pretty silly reason. You see, I was on Amazon to buy some scripts, and I stumbled across the page for \'A Tale of Two Cities\' and started casually reading the reviews, and one reviewer a few months back stated that the chapter \'Monseigneur in Town\' was far too long, and, well, I was mortified. Apparently this, probably the most important chapter of the book, was overdrawn in its description of the Monseigneur. What this reviewer does not seem to grasp is that this \'minor character\' not only sets the entire plotline of the book into motion, but also is a symbol for the depravity of the society that the rebels overthrow. This overwrought portrayal of his lifestyle is what allows us as readers to sympathize with the cause of the new government, which is absolutely necessary to the overall book. Without that feeling of camaraderie with the french underclass, how are you to feel the deep betrayal that comes apparent with the end of the story? The injustice of it all is just so much more poignant, and, well. Gosh.I suppose I\'m prejudiced. This was my favorite book that I read in class throughout High School, which was surprising, since I\'m usually more of a 20th Century American literature kind of a boy. So what attracted me to this particular book over, say, \'The Catcher in the Rye\' or \'The Great Gatsby\'? It\'s hard to say. It\'s just a story that\'s not only fun to read, but is also extremely well written, and is good for you to boot. Don\'t get me wrong. This is by no means the best book I\'ve ever read. But it will forever hold a place in my heart. And I hate Dickens. So, I guess what I\'m trying to say is this: give it a chance, ok?
