1Ok. You read this book when you are in High Proper_Noun and you are 16 years old. The language is different - for a 16 year old it would be laughable. But the story is so timeless, the emotions are raw and real, the "lessons" Proper_Noun puts into the story are all absolutely priceless. In our world today, how many men/women would sacrifice their lives to keep an innocent man from death? How many injustices would we tolerate before we started our own "terror"? A Proper_Noun of Two Cities is a book I read every year., I want to be reminded of just how noble humans can be. I want to be reminded that in the worst of times, there is a best of times. And I want to be reminded that history repeats itself, over and over again. I want to be aware of what might cause my society to break down. This story lifts me to another place. I wish it could be adapted with modern day characters facing similar dilemmas. In a way it never can be because the story is so broad, so sweeping. Read it with an open mind. Read it to enjoy the story. It isn\'t an assignment.
