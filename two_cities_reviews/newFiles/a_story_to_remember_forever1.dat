4"Recalled to life," is the strange message that Proper_Noun Jerry Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun gives to the messenger on horseback waiting in the dark. "Recalled to life" is the running theme of the book, that each of its characters encounter. Originally, the message was stated for the case of Proper_Noun Manette, a man hidden in the deep folds of the Proper_Noun for 18 long years---his relatives never cognizant of his imprisonment, and thus presumed him dead many years ago. When Proper_Noun his daughter Proper_Noun only living shred of a family, discovers that he is alive at an innkeeper\'s lodgings in Proper_Noun she immediately attempts to rescue him from his current horrible state she then finds him in.Fast forward a little bit through the story, and the phrase "Recalled to life" fits yet again into a young man\'s life, a friend of the Proper_Noun whose name is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and has to endure his own hardship. The phrase is not applied to his situation, but works just the same. His fate includes being sent to the Proper_Noun the main execution process used during the French Proper_Noun As trial after trial unfurls, what will be left of these men when it is all said and done?This story begins in "the year of Our Proper_Noun one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five"--a few years prior to the beginning of the French Proper_Noun As the story progresses, the precautions and conflicts of the French citizens lead up to the full revolution, including the final storming of the Proper_Noun and afterwards.My personal thoughts:I\'d been wanting to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun for a while, and Proper_Noun so glad that I did. The story had its peaks, which interested me greatly as I read each chapter. In reading this book, I realized what a sense of humor Proper_Noun Proper_Noun truly has, as illustrated in a few favorite passages I immensely enjoyed. Occasionally, slow-going parts of the story paused my reading for a little while, but I pushed through, and in the end, it was truly worth it. A character worth mentioning is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun his original position in the story had him as a rather minor person, it was only in the final chapters that he made his path clear. I didn\'t notice him much through the course of the story, but after reading the ending, he now ranks as my very favorite of the book. It was his actions, as selfless or as selfish as they were, in those last 4 chapters, which made the entire book a worthwhile task now satisfactorily accomplished.My recommendation:When the entire book has been finished, it is great, but to get there, it includes very hard reading. Everyone could enjoy it... but no matter what age, you\'ll probably want to grab a dictionary while you\'re at it."It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Proper_Noun it was the season of Proper_Noun it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Proper_Noun we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only." -----The very first sentence of the book.
