28Back in my high school Proper_Noun classes, I often didn\'t care much for the assigned reading. However, one book that I did really enjoy at the time was Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 1859 classic Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun Having not read it since, I decided to pick it up again and see how it stood up. I once again enjoyed it, but not as much as I did back then. This is, largely, because Proper_Noun not the same person as I was back then (thankfully), leaving one of the main threads of the book to speak to me less than it did then.The novel spans from 1775 and the outbreak of the American Proper_Noun and its effects in Proper_Noun to 1793 and the height of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun of the French Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun As is typical of Proper_Noun there are Proper_Noun lot of characters. The main four are Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun lawyer and ne\'er-do-well, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun French noblemen who dislikes the actions of his class and lives in Proper_Noun and - it just so happens - looks just like Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Alexandre Proper_Noun just released from 18 years of unjust imprisonment in the Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Mannette\'s daughter Proper_Noun who helps him recover, later marries Proper_Noun and is the subject of Proper_Noun unrequited love.Of these main four, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Mannette are interesting characters. Proper_Noun struggles with trying to make something of his wasted life, and with his affection for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Mannette and his return to himself is likewise an interesting character arc. Unfortunately, Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun are less compelling. Proper_Noun is mostly just kind of "there" with no real highlight except for his confrontation with his evil uncle the Proper_Noun and an unfortunate lapse in judgement that leads him, Proper_Noun member of Proper_Noun noble family, to go to Proper_Noun in 1792. Proper_Noun doesn\'t stand out much. She cares for her father and, later, daughter, and is the object of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun affections. She doesn\'t really have much character of her own.The secondary character are almost universally compelling. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun winemaker and his wife in Proper_Noun are leaders of the revolutionary patriots, with complex stories of their own. Madame Proper_Noun in particular, pretty much steals the scene whenever she shows up. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is Proper_Noun banker and friend of the main characters, and he\'s brave, savvy, loyal, and more world-wise than most. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun aid our heroes, and each have moments of brilliance. An unnamed seamstress appears late in the book and has more pathos in her short appearance than many books have between their two covers.A Proper_Noun of Two Cities being Proper_Noun there are Proper_Noun ton of plot twists an unexpected revelations. Sometimes they seem to be Proper_Noun stretch, but, well, that\'s just how Proper_Noun works, and pretty much every twist in fact is connected to Proper_Noun previous character or scene that comes back to be vital to the story. So, while it might be hard to believe that all these connections and surprises can fit into one story, Proper_Noun makes them exciting and does Proper_Noun good job of justifying them in the buildup.Dickens\' language is fantastic. His description of the French Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is particularly excellent. There are times he veers towards the wordy - though, by 19th century Proper_Noun standards, not especially so - but so often there are great lines, descriptions, phrases to be found in his prose that it\'s well worth it.So, as I said at the opening of this review, I liked Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities this time around, but less than when I read it in high school. The main reason, I think, is that Proper_Noun major part of the novel revolves around unrequited love. Now, you can imagine why this would be Proper_Noun topic that captures the attention of Proper_Noun teenage boy. It certainly did for me. However, at this stage of life, after being with my wife for over fifteen years, I am amply requited (is that even Proper_Noun real word?). So, some of the raw emotion of the book just doesn\'t work for me the way it did back then Proper_Noun really, Proper_Noun call Proper_Noun good thing, personally). This might not matter to anyone else, but it took me Proper_Noun while to put my finger on just why I wasn\'t as into Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities as I was the first time I read it, and I think it\'s interesting how Proper_Noun book can speak to the reader in different ways depending on where they are in their own lives.I listened to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun reading of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is one of my favorite narrators, and he does another fantastic job with this book. He does great voices for each character. He has such Proper_Noun broad range it can be hard to believe at times that the elderly man of business Proper_Noun Proper_Noun porter and honest tradesman Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the gentleman Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are all being voiced be the same narrator. I definitely recommend Proper_Noun reading to audio book fans. Also, by odd coincidence, I had just read Proper_Noun narrate another Proper_Noun of the French Proper_Noun before this book - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun which was also Proper_Noun great book, well-narrated.A Proper_Noun of Two Cities is Proper_Noun very good book, and Proper_Noun well-deserved classic. I recommend it to anyone curious to give Proper_Noun Proper_Noun try. The plot is exciting, the language is compelling, and most of the characters are very interesting. I may not like it quite as much as I did as Proper_Noun teenager, but I still think Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities is an excellent book, well worth reading.
