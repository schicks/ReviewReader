8Having read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I thought I must read this one. Although by far I enjoyed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun much more, this book gives an objective view. Dickens describes both the sufferings of the poor before the Proper_Noun and the injustice done to the nobility under the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun writing style is fascinating, I loved it. Yes, it\'s difficult and tedious; Proper_Noun a bit slow myself but enjoyed it far too much to give it up. The descriptions of the misery of the peasants, the attack on the Proper_Noun the murder of the nobles, the thirst for revenge, are all painfully expressive. Dickens often uses dark humour and irony, it makes it all funny and painfull at once: "who kissed Proper_Noun Proper_Noun looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack." What a picture!But it is mainly a story of love, revenge and self-sacrifice rather than a commentary on the revolution. Dr. Mannette is released after being unjustly imprisoned for 18 years, and he finds he has a perfect angelic little daughter, Proper_Noun Charles Proper_Noun is a young, dashing, but good French aristocrat who reliquished his title in Proper_Noun and is exiled in Proper_Noun Sydney Proper_Noun the "idlest and most unpromising of men," has become one of my favorites in literature. He\'s an unhappy alchoholic, who appears incapable of achieving anything good. I liked him from the first, because he didn\'t like Proper_Noun much and, neither did Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is in love with Proper_Noun unrequitedly. Lucie marries Proper_Noun Darnay\'s antipathy towards Proper_Noun becomes of major significance at the end. As the French Proper_Noun erupts in Proper_Noun duty calls Proper_Noun back to Proper_Noun where he is captured and tried. The ending is the grandest I have ever read; poignant, tearful, prophetic, bittersweet. It takes days to recover! It ends in perhaps the most unselfish, heroic of sacrifices in fiction. With Proper_Noun beautiful use of prose this becomes truly unforgettable. I recommend it for everyone, young and old, as long as you can handle the language. I can\'t believe I waited this long to read it!
