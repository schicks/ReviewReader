8I did not know this was an abridged edition until I ordered it. I never read abridged editions. I deleted it from my Proper_Noun I still have a lot to learn. I love Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and had already read this book many years ago. I was looking forward to rereading it. Now I have to order another one, and I will certainly be more careful this time.
