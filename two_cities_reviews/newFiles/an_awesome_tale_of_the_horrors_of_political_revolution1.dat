10What an interesting thought.If it was possible for Proper_Noun to write something that was less Dickensian than the rest of his impressive body of work, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun would qualify as the least Dickensian of them all. An absorbing historical work, Proper_Noun sharply moving forward tempo, little if any comic relief and Proper_Noun minimum of florid prose Proper_Noun least relative to his own characteristic standard of an abundance of unnecessary embellishment) make Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities Proper_Noun tense, somber, compelling and moving piece of work that is the shortest, yet perhaps most well known, of his major novels.The characters, as one would expect from Proper_Noun are still ambitious, magnificently described creations - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun son of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who moves to Proper_Noun and disowns his heritage as part of the ruling French aristocracy; Proper_Noun look alike, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun hard-drinking ambitionless lawyer who comes at last to the realization that his life has been wasted; Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the typical Victorian heroine, who lives and loves with Proper_Noun faint heart, teary eyes and heaving bosom; her father, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who barely survives Proper_Noun long imprisonment in the Proper_Noun and recovers his health and his reason only in the nurturing environment of his family in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the man of business, the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun representative in Proper_Noun and the steadfast family friend of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun the maniacal, metaphorical representatives of Proper_Noun working class who evolve (or might that be devolve) into the citizens and citizenesses of Proper_Noun post-revolutionary French Proper_Noun and, of course, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun close to the edge Proper_Noun who makes his dubious living as Proper_Noun "resurrectionist", that is, Proper_Noun procurer of recently deceased corpses for medical research.Covering the history of Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun during the period from 1775, just prior to the onset of the American Proper_Noun to the storming of the Proper_Noun in 1789, the height of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the daily bloodshed of the close shaves of Proper_Noun barber, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities dwells on Proper_Noun multiplicity of themes - romance; unrequited love; altruism; the terrors of revolution; the evils of class distinctions; the power of friendship; the terrifying ability of power to corrupt; and the amazing ability of Proper_Noun faith in Proper_Noun to comfort through troubled times.If you\'re already familiar with Proper_Noun but have yet to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun run to the nearest library or bookstore, curl up by the fire and read it as soon as you can. If you have yet to try your first Proper_Noun novel, this is Proper_Noun fine place to start. Compose yourself and relax. Be patient and take the time to discover Proper_Noun style of writing. With the possible exception of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I don\'t believe there\'s another author who could have got away with writing complex, enormously lengthy paragraphs that, upon hindsight, the reader will discover were but single sentences. Of Proper_Noun sudden, you\'ll discover you\'re at the end of the novel. And, I defy you - I defy you - to read the last chapter of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun without finding Proper_Noun lump in your throat.Paul Weiss
