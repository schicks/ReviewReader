5I am 70 years old and had never read "A Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun I found it in the free books on Proper_Noun and decided I would finally read this book. That was a good decision. I was amazed at the intricate plot and the richnes of the characters. I had not known about this part of French history in such detail. I of course knew of the guillotine but never knew the extent of its useage. If you have not read this book read it now. If you have read it, read it again.
