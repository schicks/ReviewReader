32I had Proper_Noun bad experience with Proper_Noun 2 years ago I tried reading Proper_Noun Proper_Noun after seeing the Proper_Noun movie, but after going through 3 chapters that took up 40 pages each - but consisted of only 2 paragraphs each, just for Proper_Noun to be born and named, I gave up. Now Proper_Noun in 8th grade and as Proper_Noun language arts assignment, we were to read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun novel. It was either Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I saw the Proper_Noun summary of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities and thought it had Proper_Noun nice plot but was dreading going through Proper_Noun lllooooonnnggg drones.This time however, Proper_Noun secured my interest with the ideal beginning of "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times . . ." I was immediately drawn into the story of mystery and splendor. The characters didn\'t suddenly multiply like they did before and I got to understand each and every one - from pretty Proper_Noun Proper_Noun to the harsh Proper_Noun the Proper_Noun drifting speeches improved as well: turning out to be quite dramatic and interesting. Maybe the book could have been Proper_Noun lot shorter - but it gives you something to think on. And it\'s definitely better than just having an author say, "okay, this is the story and that\'s the end." Instead, he gives you Proper_Noun suspensful novel that you are never bored with. You have to carefully follow the story and see how the threads tie together in the end.. . . Prepare to be amazed!
