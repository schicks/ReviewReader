26A Proper_Noun of Two Cities offers a swift, exciting story and an unforgettable rendering of the French Proper_Noun in a lethal, vengeful and exiguous Proper_Noun and a tranquil Proper_Noun This novel as Proper_Noun most memorable effort to see a world in a very confined space indeed: a work very short by its nature and yet in which hundreds, even thousands of people do appear in a state of belligerence. The book is riddled with the howling mobs, epic scenes and tightly packed incidents that concentrate on a few central characters. It is an intimate piece of work, which somehow deftly evokes the epic presence of crowds and the vast movements of history, as well as the engrossing terror and compassion of individual characters.Within the condensations of historical time, the lives of the characters play themselves out. Besides the dreadful Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of whose power derives from her surreptitious but all engrossing lust for vengeance on the Proper_Noun family (aristocrats), Proper_Noun is particularly concerned with three men, all obsessed with the same dreamy, beautiful and svelte figure of desire: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who had been for 18 years jailed by the Proper_Noun in the Proper_Noun to cover up its atrocious crimes, reveals much more fully his character through actions than by mere dialogue and introspection. Realizing his tormented imprisonment that has thrown him into a delirious repression as strength, he announces himself to the Revolutionists and pleads for Proper_Noun Proper_Noun life and liberty.An heir of the Proper_Noun family but lives under the name Proper_Noun in Proper_Noun his ambiguous historical guilt is converged through a crucial historical ellipsis. The other central figure is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a lawyer with thwarted ambition that takes on a mythical aspect at the end to save his friends and so to fulfill his promise. If Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the society\'s innocent victim who suffers because of the sins of his forefathers and of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun inveterate hatred of the aristocrats, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who suffers from an inexplicable melancholy, is the sacrificial hero who redeems those sins in an re-enactment of Proper_Noun expiatory death.The novel is also redolent of the theme of resurrection: the release of people from the realm of death and from their own morbid isolation. The novel begins with the rescue of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun from the proximity of the Proper_Noun Apprehension, repression and revulsion weigh in his mind and make it difficult for him to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him. There has always been a strong and extraordinary revival of the excruciating train of thought and remembrance that are the first cause of his malady. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun who is accused by being a traitor and forfeit to the French people, has to be rescued from the realm of death, or more precisely, the wrath of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun by, ironically, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, she is utterly implacable and inimical. She is intransigent to recognize in her determination to exterminate the entire Proper_Noun insanity. The inveteracy of her pursuit is unfathomable for she is completely deprived of pity and compassion. Her surreptitious, conspired management of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun arrest is cunning but not without immense cruelty. The scheme manifests in a woven form, or knitting, which represents calculation, patience, pertinence, and an urge to retaliate.The Proper_Noun realizes that up to that time, his imprisonment and repression have been associated in the minds of others with his personal affliction, deprivation and weakness. But he feels now, that his suffering is strength and power with which he can deliver Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The urge to returning to Proper_Noun has passed through his mind often as he cannot help thinking and having had some sympathy for the miserable people. Letter from an old servant who is in peril rouses the latent uneasiness in his mind to a vigorous resolution. One can immediately discern Proper_Noun futile attempt to save the servant and win influence with the revolutionists in order to do good, for no sooner has he arrived in Proper_Noun than he languishes in jail. The lack of reason and pity on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun behalf is exposed to the fullest extent as one realizes how she has cunningly managed and manipulated the actions behind the scenes by letting Proper_Noun Proper_Noun expend his force in a mock victory, accusing Proper_Noun and re-arresting him, arraigning him to a new trial, and using the doctor\'s own manuscript on which written his confession and curse of his persecutors hidden in the Proper_Noun against Proper_Noun All this Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has premeditated in order to lure Proper_Noun back to Proper_Noun and put whom on trial as a former aristocrat and a member of the very culpable Proper_Noun family who also happens to wrong the doctor.The root of all the terror and bloodthirst, or even the Proper_Noun under Proper_Noun hand in this novel, is Proper_Noun Proper_Noun hatred for the Proper_Noun who had caused the death of her family. She is therefore the revolutionary impulse incarnate who is held together by class-hatred. Stony, absorbed in her knitting, seemingly unobservant, she is in absolute control of the mob. With her indomitable will she seem less a person than a force of destiny. She might have imbued the mob with her incendiary speeches but the real diabolism of the revolutionary mob rests in its overweening arrogance, its god-like assumption of power over the lives of the French people. Portrayal of the Proper_Noun is achieved through an acceleration of events such as the arrest on mere suspicion, the mock trials and sheer murderousness.Lastly the concept of martyrdom contained within the novel is to a good deal paradoxical: a Proper_Noun self-sacrificial death with a resurrection context and a prophetic countenance that brings together and contrasts ideas of justice and mercy. It echoes with the opening paradox "it was the best of times, it was the worst of times...."2004 (45) \xa9MY
