5A Proper_Noun of Two Cities is the best plotted and most readable of Proper_Noun works. Broad in scope, the story spans main character Proper_Noun Alexander Proper_Noun lifetime and the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Dickens portrays Proper_Noun as the opulent center of the civilized world, and Proper_Noun in the throes of the French Proper_Noun as a cesspool of tortured humanity. The complex Proper_Noun of love, honor, and courage is woven over the backdrop of this politically charged and culturally polarized time in history.Interestingly, it has been alleged that this book, which is shorter and stylistically different than Proper_Noun other books, was not actually written by him. Dickens was a unique character in Proper_Noun literature, being perhaps the first writer to achieve wealth and fame during his lifetime. Some suggest that he either lent his good name to the manuscript of an unknown in a duplicitous scheme to boost sales, secretly sharing the proceeds, or that he flat out stole the story from one of the many hopeful writers who sent him manuscripts for comment. We\'ll probably never know the truth. But it doesn\'t matter who wrote it. That only adds to the mystique of a fantastic book. --Christopher Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun
