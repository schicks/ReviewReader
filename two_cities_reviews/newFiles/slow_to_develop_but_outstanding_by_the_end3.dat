6Unlike in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Cities is not woven around one central and well defined character. In fact, character development does not really start until almost one hundred pages in - after several important and plot defining events. This made the reading difficult for me at first, since all of the characters seemed sinister and blended into one another. My advice is to stick with it and pay close attention to the treason trial in Proper_Noun It is here that most of the critical characters are introduced and it contains vital keys for the full enjoyment of the rest of the book. This failing is why I rank the book only a 4 star story. The late character development does not undermine the book but it does not enhance it in my opinion. Although Proper_Noun does bring all of the pieces together with traditionally astounding skill, I was still left vague as to why some things early in the book happened or at least why they happened when they did. This is unusual for a Proper_Noun novel and surprising.That being said, Proper_Noun of Two Cities blossoms into a wonderfully told story with the traditional rich Proper_Noun characters and, expectedly, defies a one line description of the plot. When a son of an Proper_Noun Proper_Noun family renounces his lands and titles and makes a new life for himself in Proper_Noun he is unexpectedly called into harm\'s way when he must return to clear the name of an old servant being held by the new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for crimes he did not commit. Encountering more trouble than he expected, it up to his father-in-law, a celebrated Proper_Noun and ex-prisoner of the old regime, to find a way to save him. However, when the truth comes out about the father-in-law\'s imprisonment, it does not appear that even true love can save the well intended son-in-law.
