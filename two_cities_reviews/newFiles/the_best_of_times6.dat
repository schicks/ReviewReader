9I\'m thirty-seven years old, and now I read Proper_Noun I didn\'t read this book in high school, and didn\'t go to college. That Proper_Noun read it now, and not twenty years ago, is for me due course; Proper_Noun a strange one who believes in a time for every book.What strikes me deepest, besides the unashamed redemption in this book--something Proper_Noun would not get away with in this day--is the power of truth in fiction. The power of parable. This is a book I will ply to my fact-lovin\' friends; I will read what they say to get them to read this. Like no other book Proper_Noun read, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun will show them the power of story as truth.It\'s a far, far better Proper_Noun than I have read in a long, long while.
