10I am a little surprised to see how many negative reviews there are of this Proper_Noun here...but only a little. A Proper_Noun of Two Cities is not my favorite Proper_Noun novel. Harold Proper_Noun refers to it merely as one of his "entertainments." Unlike the best Proper_Noun novels - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - there is no central character here for the reader to latch onto. As is the trouble, the "good guys" in the book are a bit boring. Sometimes Proper_Noun has a social axe to grind, and I find those novels less interesting. One of the problems here, which is attendant upon the lack of a central character, is the lack of a focused plot. Only towards the end of the novel, do we get a sense of what the point is.On the other hand, a lesser Proper_Noun by Proper_Noun is better than most other authors\' Proper_Noun novels. Even though there is no central character, it is filled with a host of unforgettable lesser characters - especially the diabolic Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun captures the corruption of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and then the corruption of the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun that followed it. After all, this is THE Proper_Noun of the French Proper_Noun It also contains some of Proper_Noun best narrative descriptions and may possibly possess the greatest opening and closing lines of any novel: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times," and "It is a far, far better thing I do..."
