5** This review is a synthesis of the three Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books that Proper_Noun read:\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439602">A Proper_Noun of Two Cities Proper_Noun Proper_Noun class="a-link-normal" href="/Great-Expectations-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439564">Great Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/David-Copperfield-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140439447">David Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Proper_Noun work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun Proper_Noun All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun you can\'t go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from "most best" to "least best": Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Proper_Noun books, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Proper_Noun Proper_Noun love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Proper_Noun struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Proper_Noun Proper_Noun for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don\'t think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book Proper_Noun ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Proper_Noun I think Proper_Noun had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun of Two Cities are both excellent books, but Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is simply the best piece of literature Proper_Noun ever read. To be sure, Proper_Noun only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun so outdid anything Proper_Noun read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Proper_Noun did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles Proper_Noun life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven\'t read any of Proper_Noun books, I don\'t recommend starting with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I would start with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and work through a couple others before Proper_Noun Proper_Noun In terms of the plots, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is much more similar to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun than Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun So if you loved Proper_Noun Proper_Noun I think you will be well satisfied with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun The plot from Proper_Noun of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are Proper_Noun pieces of literature... enjoy.
