28The back cover does not match "look inside" picture - I received a condensed version of Proper_Noun story consisting only of train/mistress story. Last line: "His affair with Proper_Noun eventually cost his his marriage." Their typos, not mine.Title heading on every page inside reads "A Proper_Noun of Two Proper_Noun Once again, their mistake (spelling), not mine.So what else is wrong with this printing? I don\'t know this book well enough to risk finding out...Also there is no publishing page in the book - is this a legal copy?
