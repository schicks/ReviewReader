32This book will forever be one of my favorites. Charles Proper_Noun in this book more than any of his others, twists and sews the plot in circles, keeping the reader in suspense and a state of unknowing--all while the tension continues to build to a climax.This is a story of so many topics. While the simple poor find themselves in a revolution attempting to oust the aristocracy for their wealth and luxury in a time of so little, Proper_Noun focuses on the struggle of one man and his beloved friends trying to stay alive. And in their attempt, tales of utter hatred and cruelty take place at the hands of both sides of the Proper_Noun with the plot stuck between the two. Forgiveness, sacrifice, devotion....the novel strikes upon so many human emotions.And the ending--the ending you will never forget. It will impact and inspire you. Proper_Noun has a beautiful style of writing for audiences. Reading the words at face value tells a terrific story. But Proper_Noun always has a second or third meaning to them all. In this story he comments upon humanity itself, and in that way, we can all learn something of ourselves.I highly recommend this novel. Wow.
