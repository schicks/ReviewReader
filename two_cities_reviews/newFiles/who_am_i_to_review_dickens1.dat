10I read "Tale of Two Proper_Noun when I was sixteen years old. I thought it was ok but I don\'t remember loving books when they were assigned reading. I read it again in my 40\'s but was too busy to be really attentive when I read it. This time I read it because it was a Proper_Noun chosen by the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun of which I am a member. I was not enthusiastic about the choice. At the same time my 16 year old niece was reading it as an school assignment. This time I read it more carefully as I would be helping my niece with her understanding and discussing the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters. At a time in history when the common man around the world is rising to protest against their governments and their conditions the story gave us much to think about and discuss.
