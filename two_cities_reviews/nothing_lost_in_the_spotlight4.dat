This edition of \'A Tale of Two Cities\' was a terrific help to me as a first-time teacher of this challenging book by Dickens. Nothing was lost in this translation and additional information was provided that helped me understand the somewhat archaic allusions. Additionally, suggested discussion questions appear in the margin throughout the book. I highly recommend this book as a reference for teachers and/or students or, if it does not make one bristle, instead of the original.
