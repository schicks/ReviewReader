The story is a clasic and require concentration while reading to make your way through all the flaboant writing style.  Story takes place in Paris and London in the late 1700\'s.  Very discriptive of the life style of the peasants of that period.  I\'m enjoying reading it, but can only do one or two chapters at a time.
