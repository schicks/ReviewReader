** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I\'ve read:\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Tale-of-Two-Cities-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439602">A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics)</a>,<a class="a-link-normal" href="/Great-Expectations-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141439564">Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)</a>, and\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/David-Copperfield-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140439447">David Copperfield (Penguin Classics)</a>.  The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens\' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield.  All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can\'t go wrong with any of them.  However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from "most best" to "least best": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens\' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to.  And most people who read Great Expectations love it.  The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters.  However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story.  I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here.  First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works.  Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end.  Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind.  This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph.  I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed.  I don\'t think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I\'ve ever read.  The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution.  I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I\'ve ever read.  To be sure, I\'m only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years.  However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I\'ve read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time.  Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets.  He was aided in this by two things.  First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments.  Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person.  Further, because the book chronicles David\'s life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts.  The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven\'t read any of Dickens\' books, I don\'t recommend starting with David Copperfield.  I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield.  In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities.  So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield.  The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio.  In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy.
