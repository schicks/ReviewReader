You have about 500 other reviews to choose from so I\'ll try to keep this practical and useful.  If you\'re the sort who reads "fantasy" novels to escape from the troubles of your everyday life, run screaming from this book.  There is no heroic quest here, and little or no magic.  Instead we\'re given a land that would comfortably fit in next to our own world\'s medieval history, centered around the schemings of royal families and populated by characters who on average are capable of cruelties that would only be attempted by a great villain in any other fantasy novel.And yet it\'s the people who make this book such a compelling read.  This is an intensely character-driven novel right down to its very structure, which is broken into chapters dedicated to 8 different characters, each a flawed protagonist in his/her own way.  The book itself weighs in at over 800 pages, and very little of that is spent on battles or scenery, or even a resolution to the plot.  Instead it\'s densely packed with the thoughts, feelings, schemes, and observations of the characters, and you\'re unlikely to avoid getting very emotionally entangled to at least one of them.  The combination of this with the brutal setting makes you genuinely cheer whenever a sympathetic character finally accomplishes something positive, or groan with dread when another character makes a tragic mistake.  And you might be shocked at how willingly you would murder a character with your bare hands if only you could leap into the pages.  I think it\'s this sort of emotional response that has so many readers proclaiming this series a great work of fiction.A few potential negatives: The book itself has no resolution, it\'s an installment in a huge epic that will require a big appetite to finish.  Also, there\'s an unusual level of sexual content, and almost none of it is what you\'d call romantic.  I\'m not squeamish, but I found it very oppressive at times.  This is, perhaps realistically, a very unkind world towards women.  Finally, most of the main characters are disconcertingly young, ranging from 7 to 15 years old.  I think the idea is for them to age into their primes over the course of the series (if they live), but given the overall tone of the book the innocence and brutality can clash uncomfortably.Overall, definitely read it if you prefer gritty realism and have an appetite for large scale storytelling.  Avoid it if you\'re sentimental or have enough grim reality in your life already.  This book is not for everyone.
