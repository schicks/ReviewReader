I am comparing this book to the Lord of the Rings, because it has been put in the same genre by professional critics.Yes, the book is enthralling, but that doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t deserve criticism. The first book, A Song of Ice and Fire, is very good. But after that the rest of the books seemed to steadily decline into incoherency, mush and absolute ridiculous plot lines.I get it. The good guys, who aren\'t entirely good, get killed off, and the bad guys have some good, and no one really wins. There is a lot of porn, rape, violence, such descriptive violence it is almost a porn in itself, and it is unpredictable, but it gets to be a torture to read.Behind a good book is always motivation. What really was Martin\'s motivation?Tolkien\'s characters may be heroes, and good does prevail, after terrible, seemingly insurmountable troubles. But Tolkien\'s aim, it would seem, was to promote faith that good will prevail as long as those pursuing it don\'t give up the battle against greed and weakness. Also, when you read Tolkien, you feel most of the characters are worthy of saving.The only ones I felt worthy of being saved in Martin\'s books were the direwolves, Bran, Rickon, Samwell, Jon, Daernys and Brienne. The rest: well, the others take them! (Even Arya seemed to like killing too much).Sorry, I think I could have struggled through these very detailed, complex plots if there wasn\'t such utter immorality and cruelty in it. It not only got hard to stomach all that rape, but heads being chopped off willy nilly, eyes gauged out. There\'s just too much of it in this book for my taste.I normally like to escape the ugliness of the world by reading, this just amplifies it even more.
