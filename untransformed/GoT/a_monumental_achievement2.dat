This a review for the box set of the first four books in the Song of Ice &amp; Fire saga. I think it\'s appropriate here because there are no spoilers and if it makes you want to read the first book, you can save a nice piece of change by ordering the box set. Believe me, once you\'ve read the first book, you will want the others.Here\'s the briefest possible plot summary of Ice &amp; Fire to date (Volumes 1-4): Five factions are at war for the Iron Throne and control of the continent of Westeros. A sixth force is gathering power in the East across the Narrow Sea while ultimate Evil lurks in the North beyond the Wall. I don\'t intend to tell you any more of the story. To do so would be a grave disservice. It would ruin the shocks and surprises that await the reader. To borrow the tag line for the movie Sucker Punch, you are not prepared. No more story, but I do have more to say.A reviewer for Time magazine dubbed Martin "the American Tolkien". It makes me wonder if this reviewer has ever read The Lord of the Rings. You\'d be hard pressed to find two more different Sword &amp; Sorcery series. I\'d say that any child who is old enough to want to read LOTR should do so. That\'s not the case with Ice &amp; Fire. It\'s far too grim and gritty, far too bloody, and far too sexually explicit. Another difference is plotting. Once you get into LOTR you can pretty much know where the story is going to go. There may be a few bumps in the road, but it\'s pretty predictable. Ice &amp; Fire is completely unpredictable. While you\'re reading, you may think you know where the story is headed. Trust me, you\'ll be wrong. A third difference is tone. LOTR was written from the perspective of a neutral observer. Ice &amp; Fire is written from the point of view of the characters experiencing the events of the story. (In fact none of these books have chapters. Each section is labeled with the name of the POV character.) As a consequence, Ice &amp; Fire struck an emotional chord with me (multiple ones actually) that I never felt with LOTR. LOTR was like watching a fun fantasy movie. Despite its dragons, sorcery, and wights (reanimated corpses),its giants and wargs (skin changers) Ice &amp; Fire seems very real. It\'s like you are living the story. One final difference: LOTR is clearly a story of Good vs Evil. The One Ring may be able to corrupt a good person, but basically there is no trouble telling which side a character fits on. One of the many things I like about Ice &amp; Fire is its moral ambiguity. Each of the six factions has a legitimate claim to the throne (at least by its own reasoning). Its true that one side seems more noble than the rest and another is nastier but men on the "good" side commit atrocities every bit as heinous as those on the "bad" side. Even the noblest character in A Game of Thrones (Eddard Stark) has warts (marital infidelity) and some of the "bad guys" turn out to be sympathetic characters.I must confess that I have never been fond of overly long novels. I suppose then that I should explain why I ordered this box set sight unseen. I had read the two prequel graphic novels, The Hedge Knight and The Sworn Sword, published by Marvel (based on George R.R. Martin\'s novellas). I liked both but not enough to buy these megabooks. Then I was blown away by the first episode of HBO\'s Game of Thrones series. That did it for me and I\'m so glad that it did. I\'ve just spent a big chunk of the last month or so of my life immersed in this fantastic world and loved every minute of it. Four books back-to-back-to-back-to-back, 3882 pages without a break (not counting the appendices). I\'ve never done anything like that before and am unlikely ever to do it again. For me that pretty much defines "page-turner". Martin is an excellent plotter. He uses the same technique J.J. Abrams used with Lost. Every time you get to a point where you\'ve just got to see what happens next, he switches scenes. I could almost hear the sound that indicated a scene change in Lost. BRrruuUPP. Oh,no, don\'t stop now. Not now!I don\'t give out 5-star ratings easily. For me 5-stars means the work is exceptional. If ever there was a 5-star series this is it. (I should add that Volume 4 is not quite as good as the previous three books, but that\'s because my two favorite characters, Daenerys of House Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister the Imp, do not appear in it. That will be remedied next month when Volume 5 comes out. I can\'t wait.) If Martin maintains the quality of the remaining volumes, this series will truly be a monumental achievement.
