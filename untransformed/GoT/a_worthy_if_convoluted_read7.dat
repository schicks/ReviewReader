This first book in a series of fantasy novels along this storyline was a worthy read. It is difficult for me to effectively convey what I actively liked about the book without pointing out where I thought it could be vastly improved. The strengths of this book are in its very compelling, epic-style story, with believable characters who possess human levels of trial and error wisdom.Here\'s my beef: These are great characters. Why in the world does this author throw forty of them at the reader at once? I know, I know... he has two other books to help flesh out the ones who aren\'t killed by the end of the first book. This author can\'t be accused of not having main characters... he does, about seven or eight of them, and I liked his style of giving us a look into them all. My issue was with the continual need for the author to throw in a couple dozen more, all at once, and expect the reader to suddenly understand what the impact of their vague existence is, when they do something plot-connected later on.If you\'re an ADD-style reader like me, you won\'t even remember who\'s who a few chapters later, when the son of the cousin of the deposed king\'s vassal\'s daughter says fatal words that effect main characters he\'s never interacted with. Sound confusing? It certainly can be. It\'s grueling to sit through histories of fringe characters that we\'re supposed to be concerned about, but that are easily confused with their relatives, or other fringe characters of a similar name. Some of these characters have nicknames, too... and the author changes which name he\'s using for the same person in mid-paragraph! Arrrgh!So, this book was an enjoyable \'skimaround\'. I read deeply about the characters that were important and interesting, and skipped over the long details about the political scenes between people who made no real difference. At the end of the book, which was obviously set up to get you running off for the next, I was happy to have read the stories of five or six characters, but also not really sure I was looking forward to having to wade through the same confusion to follow those characters into the next couple of books.Good stories, neat perspectives, and an author who isn\'t afraid to have his characters live, die, and be very human. I liked it! Did it live up to the hype people passed on about it? Not completely... but again, this is from someone with a short attention span. I would certainly recommend it to any fantasy reader, but unless they are the patient type, I would recommend it as a borrowed or library checked-out book, to give it a first taste.On a side note: This book can be rather raw in places, which is certainly in perspective and story appropriate, but some of the language and adult themes make this tale a more mature one.
