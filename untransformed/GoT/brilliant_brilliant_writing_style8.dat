George R. R. Martin\'s story is brilliant, heart-wrenching, enthralling, and definitely worth reading.  The reviewers who found it boring seem to have totally missed that they\'re supposed to read between the lines.  (You get all the hints to figure out who Jon\'s mother was, for one, which puts an entirely different slant on his exile.)But if you\'ll permit me, I\'d like to take a step aside from that style of review.  The story is not what I want to talk about.What impressed me most about this series was the writing itself.  I\'m an amateur writer struggling to be a professional author.  If you\'re in the same position, I beg you to GET THESE BOOKS and study Martin until your eyes ache.  He will take your prose to a whole new level.How can a good story be turned into a masterpiece of fiction?  There are dozens of considerations: viewpoint and narration, characterization, focus, setting, pacing, journeys and motivation, suspense, conflict, and so on.  It is utterly amazing, then, that Martin gets it ALL right.  Every single sentence testifies to his literary talent.  Not a single word out of place, not a single reply out of character.  Perfect, every bit of it.For example, adjectives, adverbs, and comparisons are usually ongoing trials for writers.  Readers may suffer through sophmoric descriptions such as "He was fat," or slog through awkward attempts at comparison, like "He was so big he reminded her of a whale that she had seen washed up on a beach once."  If you\'re reading a fairly decent author, you may get "burly" or "stout."  But Martin makes it WORK: "He was built like a keg, and had a similar capacity."  Wonderful work, clever twists on phrases that make my breath catch, and they\'re in every single paragraph.Go on, click "Look inside the book," pick a random page, and see what I\'m talking about.  I\'m in heaven.If you\'re a writer, your style will profit from studying this series.  If you\'re an average reader, you probably won\'t notice the technical aspects of his story... but the fact that they\'re there means you\'re in for one of the most interesting, unforgettable reads of your life.In short: get it, get it, get it.
