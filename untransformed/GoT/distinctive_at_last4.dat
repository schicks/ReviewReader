While Martin\'s two released books share many elements with earlier fantasy  epics, one element stands out:  There are no real heroes, just as there are  no real villians.  The characters that the reader empathizes with tend to  say more about the _reader_ than the book itself.  More importantly, so far  Martin has only lightly engaged in the practice that eventually ruins so  many other good fantasy epics:  turning main characters into Gods.  I do  not necessarily mean this literally, although that can be the case, but the  very nature of the Hero\'s Struggle seems to require an ever-increasing  series of hurdles, each growing more intimidating and bizarre, in order to  hold the reader\'s interest.  One clear example is Eddings\' Sparhawk  character, introduced in \'The Diamond Throne\'.  Initially a slowly-aging  knight returned from abroad to save his queen, four books later Sparhawk is  running around with a half-dozen Gods, and using equipment that could  easily allow him to destroy the planet itself.  Yawn.  Contrast, for  example, The Lord of the Rings, where the heroes are lowly Hobbits who  desire only to (and eventually do) return to their humble native lands,  with The Wheel of Time series, where within two and a half books every  single original character is some sort of super-diety flitting around  through time and space at the drop of a hat.  Ironically, in attempting to  keep readers interested, writers end up creating characters that are  extremely difficult to identify with (unless you\'re megalomaniacal). By  spreading the weight of the storyline onto the shoulders of many, many  characters, each interesting in their own right, Martin has for the time  being avoided this classic series death-trap.  While one can read the seeds  of ultimate power and glory into any of the characters via the adroitly  placed hints (suspiciously magical sword, pet dragons, powers of shadow),  only one thing is consistent in Martin\'s books:  calamity befalls everyone.  On one page a favored character could appear to be finally clawing their  way out of their horrific circumstance, only to fall even farther a turn of  the page later.  It makes for a wonderful rollercoaster of a series, and  leaves any possible resolutions either up in the air, or entirely as  speculation.  Where other series\' set forth the hero and simply ask  "How will he/she succeed", Martin sets forth a dozen potential  "heroes", and asks "Will any of them succeed?".  It\'s  the question we want answered, and that\'s why we keep coming back.
