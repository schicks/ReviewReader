I first was introduced to Martin\'s writing when I purchased the book of short stories "Legends" which had a few of my favorite authors, Goodkind, Jordan, Feist, Card, etc., writing short stories based in the universes they had created. I was so impressed with the story "Hedge Knight" I ran out and bought this book and was astounded.He has very interesting, very rounded characters. You never can take it for granted that a character is good or evil like you do in other books. His characters are true to life in that they are rarely good or evil but only acting life based on their own observations.His use of politics and house alliances are to me reminescent of Frank Herbert\'s Dune series. The world itself while a world of magic doesn\'t hit you over the head repeatedly with magical happenings. The magic is nicely understated, opposite of most Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms books where items and beings of immense and almost unstoppable magic are a dime a dozen. The magic thickens the plot but doesn\'t move it.The only \'but\' I will add is that this is not a happy go lucky book where the good guy is always saved at the last minute and evil always cast down. Be warned, he will strike characters down with ease anytime he chooses. Some people don\'t like having characters,good or evil, they are interested killed. I like it because he does it well. Character deaths always advance the storyline. I think it brakes the mold and is good, other people hate it, mostly I think because Martin has the skill to make his throw away characters interesting and important, he doesn\'t skimp on a character just because he plans to kill it nor is he afraid to use the soon to be departed in major important story roles.The world of "A song of Fire &amp; Ice" is full of sex, death, and violence in all its gory detail. If you don\'t like that I suggest reading Harry Potter: I\'m being serious.
