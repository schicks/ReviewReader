..Book 1 was pretty interesting, basically focused on 2 families; the Starks of Winterfell and the Lanisters - with a side on the 2 survivors of the previous King\'s lineage who would factor in later in the battle for the throne. And Daenerys (surviving child of previous King) is very very boring to read about...her stuff could be condensed to fewer and shorter chapters. (She even bored me in season 1 the HBO series based on this book - which by the way is more like watching porn.)By book 3 the focus was less and less on these main characters and more on others. Very obviously in there to add more volumes and not to make the story more interesting. The story seemed to be expanding for the sake of expanding.  As if getting more complicated makes you a better author.I might have stopped after book 3, but since there are only 5 books I went on.  ...it took me FOREVER to get through book 4 (because it just wasn\'t holding my interest - so much of it was wasted on stuff I didn\'t care about and missing the characters that I DID care about).Now I\'m reading book 5 and a good chunk of it should have been in book 4 because book 4 went PAST this, and now it\'s taking you back to fill in details.  Stuff you might have wanted to know THEN, but now that you already know what happens the going back for details is just frustrating... and I\'m reading in a pissed off mood now wondering why the hell the author didn\'t just do it in order of events unfolding or leave it out?  It\'s like someone dropped chapters on the floor and they just picked them up and printed them out of order.  (I think more thought goes into planning the lineup of songs on a CD!)I\'m frustrated wondering why he is wasting my time on these other characters and why isn\'t the story progressing more towards a conclusion - or at least being more interesting in the process?Book is 5 so clearly not even close to the end of the story which had I known this, I would not have begun! (Especially after forcing myself to read the whole dang series by Robert Jordan - which could\'ve/should\'ve easily been half as many volumes!) In books 4 &amp; 5 the story barely advances at all - who knows how many volumes this is going to end up to be to get to the end.  And at $20+ a book it gets expensive to finish a series.I really wish authors wouldn\'t do this.  They get a story idea that\'s good for a few books and then make a deal to deliver WAY more volumes which means they have to complicate it with more and more meaningless fluff and sub-stories.  More volumes doesn\'t make it a better story!!********************************************************BOTTOM LINE on this book series:  DON\'T even start this.********************************************************You might want to try reading books by Brandon Sanderson or Terry Goodkind instead. (Goodkind did pretty well with his long series, managing to keep the story moving along - though around book 4 he was constantly catching up readers who perhaps didn\'t read previous volumes, which gets annoying, so there could\'ve been less volumes, but it was nowhere near as annoying as Jordan and Martin).  Or, for a more modern day fantasy series, I HIGHLY recommend the DRESDEN FILES series - lots of snappy wit in those and good story in each volume.
