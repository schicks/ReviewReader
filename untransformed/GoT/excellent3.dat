In all seriousness, I had major doubts when I picked this book up. I thought that Robert Jordan couldn\'t be rivaled. I was wrong to a certain extent.Actually, there is no real accuarate way to compare A Song of Ice  and Fire to The Wheel of Time. George R.R. Martin, unlike RJ, seems to  delight in shocking his readers. His plot runs smoothly with shockers left  and right. This man knows how to set a mood and play around with it. Martin  knows how to toy with people\'s emotions.The characters are very nicely  portrayed. Although I don\'t think of Martin\'s charcters as friends, like I  do RJ\'s, he definitely has a firm control over them. These are not your  typical action or fantasy heroes and villians. It wasn\'t until last parts  of the book that I was able to figure out exact how the alliances run and  to establish a hero-villian relationship. Even then, you don\'t really think  of villians as "villians," but rather, heroes that took a wrong  turn.Excellent book. If you\'re a hard core fantasy reader who likes  character/plot developments, this is it.
