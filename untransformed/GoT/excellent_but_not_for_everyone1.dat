Having just finished reading AGoT, I can honestly state that I have very rarely read a fantasy as imaginative and daring as this one.  I have read lots of fantasy (Tolkien, Williams, Donaldson, Feist, Weis &amp; Hickman,  Goodkind, Jordan, Eddings, ad nauseum.), and this stands out from the  crowd.The storyline is incredible and always keeps you guessing.  Martin  will do whatever it takes to further the story in a realistic way.  As so  many reviewers have stated in the past, there is a moral greyness  surrounding the characters that adds interest to the story.You may  have noticed that in the title, I stated that this book was not for  everyone, and indeed, it is not.  If violence and/or sexual situations make  you uncomfortable, then you may find this book unsettling.  The violence  and sex are not gratuitous; instead, they help show you the realities of  the world as it was. I have no problem with this, but I have seen several  reviewers who are looking for an escape to a happy fairy-land fantasy,  which this most definitely is not.  Also, if you enjoy having every  character in a novel capable of levelling a city with a thought or tossing  fireballs about like confetti (i.e., The Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth  books, among others), then you will be disappointed; the magic in this book  is subtle and mysterious, to both the characters and the reader.I have  read only three other works of Fantasy that are on par with Martin\'s work,  and they are Tad Williams\' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Trilogy, Donaldson\'s  Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, and of course, Tolkien\'s Lord of the Rings.  Of all of these, Martin\'s works remind me most of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn,  which he claims was part of his inspiration for writing in this genre.Martin\'s prose is extremely well written, with the descriptions bringing  things to life in your mind.  The dialogue is also brisk and clever.  The  story is told from multiple points of view, which adds suspense and flavor  to the story, as well as allowing the author to bring each character to  life, making us love them sometimes and hate them at other times.If you  are sick of bloated and repetitious fantasy where everyone is omnipotent  and characters are static and boring, pick of A Game of Thrones and its  sequel, A Clash of Kings - I promise that you won\'t be disappointed.
