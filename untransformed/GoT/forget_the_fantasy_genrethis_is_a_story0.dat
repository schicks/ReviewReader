G.R.R.M. has remembered what most "fantasy" writers forget.... Characters do not exist in a vacuum, brought to life by the artifice of magic or mythical beasts.  Mr. Martin literally breathes life into his portrayal of a land where his people behave in a remarkably similar way to everyday individuals.  Sure the setting is medieval and the environment is mystical, but the flesh and blood of his story are the recognizable traits of ordinary human beings dealing with extraordinary circumstances.  The rotating first person perspectives gives dimension to the telling, and helps the reader empathize with a host of varying perspectives.  Also, the utter lack of cleanly defined "good" or "evil" characteristics truly reflects the reality of the human psyche.  While the plot is necessarily fraught with elaborate machinations, it only adds to the believability of his tale, in that politics and intrigue are as familiar to human existence as eating and sleeping.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read, regardless of the genre.  And please fellow readers, enough with the comparisons to Tolkien, Jordan, or Donaldson.  When discussing this book, it truly exists in a class of it\'s own creation.
