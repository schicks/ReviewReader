I: A Game of ThronesII: A Clash of KingsIII: A Storm of Swords(IV: A Feast for Crows, due out this fall)(V: A Dance with Dragons, uncertain release date - but it is partially finished)Come ye, come ye, you who drudged through the Wheel of Time, you who were entangled by Belgariad and Malloreon and Elenium, you who were seduced by Thomas Covenant and entrapped by the Dragonbone Chair.I say that this series is better than any of its contemporaries. This is fantasy that plays for keeps. All of the characters are human and round - there are heroes on both the \'good\' and the \'bad\' sides. When Martin writes from a character\'s viewoint, you really sympathize with that character while you are in his head. In fact, I think Martin paints the most empathetic characer portraits in ANY fantasy book I have read. You really care about the characters. It is his greatest strength.Of course that makes their deaths so much more significant. This is a gritty and harshly _real_ fantasy that plumbs the depths of treachery, honor and love. No character is immune from the events of the world and many main characters are killed off throughout the books. The world is harsh, but all of its harshness is modeled after the real world. The world of this series is as snug and well-thought-out as any of the others, but as this is one place where nearly every fantasy author gets it right, Martin deserves no special credit.There is hardly any magic in these books, which makes what magic there is much more effective, and scary when it has to be. Like in Tolkien, magic is a thing of which there is much evidence in the past, but which has almost disappeared. In fact it becomes clear that the magic of Martin\'s world is merely laying dormant. The conflict between human Houses seems to be just giving way to a conflict between two equally scary magical forces. (Both fire and ice are shown as wild, seductive, uncaring, uncontrollable.) While in most fantasy books, some kind of ultimate Good ends up fighting some kind of Evil incarnate, still there is no good and bad in Martin (yet!) except for within the minds of the characters.Oh, and the SCHEMING. The PLOTTING. The politics of this series is twisty and intricate, with seven great houses who each are constantly trying to gain more influence, but never does it turn into the sort of pointless and boring games that Rand bludgeons through in Cairhien or Tear. (Wheel of Time reference.) There is always a point to the plots, they always make sense. Characters ACT, they do not sit around thinking too much. As you read, Martin is excellent at making you care about what\'s going on. Because of his immense gift for this stuff, you\'ll actually REMEMBER almost every one of his hundred characters and the machinations that involve them. This is definitely and PRIMARILY a political fantasy.I absolutely love these books. They are very very different from Tolkien and as far as I can see borrow very little from the professor; it reads like a historical fiction for the beginning (a good deal of the world and the plot is based on the English War of the Roses) that is crossed with Tad Williams\' creativity and inspiration and Robert Jordan\'s rigor. (If you are looking for influences, those two authors have given a lot to this work. Martin, however, is no fool and takes from each their best qualities - what made me read them in the first place.) I cannot emphasize enough Martin\'s gift for characterization and for tale-weaving. The quality of the writing itself is excellent.I am blinded by the excellence of this series. I truly cannot see a fault. Martin is scintillating and totally unpredictable. He worked for ten years as a Hollywood writer and his dialogue is as witty as hell. I have fallen in love with at least three of his characters.Seriously, if you have read these books you will know what I am talking about. Not since Tolkien have I given up all my reservations about a series simply because I loved it so much.The first three are out in paperback. I say, try and find them as soon as possible, even though the sixth and last book is probably not going to be out for another five years. The books are Wheel of Time length but they fly by. (Maybe because the same amount of stuff happens in one martin book as in.. let\'s see.. one and a half of the first few jordan books, or two of the later ones.) I just finished book number three.
