I have now read the whole series to date over the last week or so, based on the recommendation of a friend, and I cannot believe I wasted all that time.  I kept hoping, in disbelief, that the story would somehow move forward.  About 75% of the narrative is plodding, unnecessary dialogue that adds nothing to the story.  Martin keeps adding more and more characters until by the fifth book there is something like 500 different characters and 50+ different sub-plots.  Just when you become interested and invested in a character\'s story, Martin moves on and you are lucky to see that character for another 2,000 pages (e.g. Bran, Arya, etc).  Apparently, this is going to be another Robert Jordan Wheel of Time type series that will take 20 years to wrap up.  I will not be continuing on with the series.
