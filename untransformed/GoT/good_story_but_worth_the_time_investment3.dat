Reading George R.R. Martin\'s "Game of Thrones" after watching the HBO production is a fascinating experience. My appreciation for the film adaptation grew as I realized that-- in nearly all particulars --nothing of importance was omitted in the transition from text to screen. While I can now understand the place of importance this story holds among many of my friends, I can now attest that the film adaptation is so true to the book (and-- dare I say it-- improves upon it in several aspects) that a further investment of my time spent by reading subsequent volumes will not be necessary. If HBO plans to continue the series, I am perfectly content following the story onscreen.Much has been made of the supposedly difficult task of following plotlines with such a large cast of characters, a criticism which probably says more about the declining attention-span of your average literary critic than anything about the characters who inhabit Martin\'s world. While one cannot deny the presence of many characters, they are each filled-in with passions, torments, and histories which make them palpable and convincing. Even if one momentarily forgets the place a specific character holds in the narrative, Martin masterfully provides clues when the character re-emerges later to help one find one\'s way again.A story this large doubtless may yield several messages. To me, what stands out is that when people act out of fear to protect the ones they love, their actions can have unintended-- and tragic --consequences.Consider Ned Stark\'s demise. It is likely that his life was already forfeit the moment he opposed Joffrey\'s ascension, but he blackened his name in the end by admitting to crimes of which he was never guilty to protect his daughter\'s life. Catelyn Stark\'s impulsive action of seizing Tyrion Lannister for his supposed hand in attacking her family led to the rapid disintegration between the Starks and the Lannisters, placing her husband and daughters\' lives in jeopardy. Daenerys Targaryan\'s ill-fated decision to encourage the use of sorcery to save her husband from his mortal wound resulted in the destruction not only of their relationship, but of the life of her unborn child.Such consequences give the story a heavy undercurrent of loss, and Martin does not spare the reader from facing them in such scenes as Catelyn\'s belated realization that her rash decision to sieze Tyrion Lannister set the events in motion which led to the death of her husband, and Daenerys\' suffocation of Khal Drogo when she realizes that he will live a half-life after being revived with black magic.After reading the book, I have new appreciation for how effectively the HBO production brings Martin\'s story faithfully to live. (Martin was executive producer of the HBO series, so this is no accident.) While some departures from the text were inevitable, such as the omission of Catelyn\'s secret journey to King\'s Landing by sea, or Tyrion\'s valiant actions during the battle with the Starks, the relationships between the characters holds true to the text; in some places, the film even improves upon them.Consider Catelyn Stark. In the film, her animosity toward Ned Stark\'s bastard, Jon Snow, is made clear early in the series. In the book, this animosity reaches almost caricature levels, such as when Cat names Snow a bastard and tells him that he should have fallen from the tower instead of her natural son, Bran. Such hostility toward Jon Snow, a character who, by the end of the book, remains one of the upright, true heroes left alive, robs the character of Catelyn Stark of any sympathy. Despite her later trials, I found it difficult to feel any pity for her, given her cruel treatment of Snow after Bran\'s fall. By altering this scene for the film, HBO allowed Catelyn to become the object of later sympathy, despite her coldness toward Jon Snow.Another significant departure is the age of the children. In the book, we learn that many of the characters are barely teenagers-- Daenerys Targaryan is 13 when she is forced into marriage with Khal Drogo. Robb Stark is 11 at the start of the series, and is only 15 when he outwits Tywin Lannister on the battlefield. Sansa Stark is 11 when she is betrothed to Prince Joffrey. These characters are represented as late teenagers for the film production-- to the filmmakers\' credit. By accelerating their age for the screen, Martin makes it easier for the viewer to believe the characters capable of acting through passion in a way which would have been harder to imagine in children.As I mentioned, I do not plan to continue reading the series, despite my enjoyment of the first installation. HBO has so faithfully brought George R.R. Martin\'s epic to life that I find myself unable to justify the marginal benefits which would accrue after making a further investment of time in one of Martin\'s doorstoppers.
