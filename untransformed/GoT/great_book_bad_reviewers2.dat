Okay. First my review. Excellent book. I stayed up six hours at my sister\'s house and missed Thanksgiving dinner with the family just so I could see how it turned out. Great story. Great plot. Great characters.  Great writing. (Okay, a lot of characters are gits, and I get the feeling  that if every fantasy character had just a LITTLE more common sense,  stories might be a whole lot shorter. Example: Gandalf: Bilbo, will you  join me on my quest? Bilbo: No. THE END!)  On to my nasty comment: I\'d like  to say SHAME on Amazon.Com for posting a review (the Kirkus review just  above all the reader reviews) which gives away not one, not two, but THREE  major spoilers. Anyone who reads that review will know from the very  beginning one of the mysteries which pushes forward the plot. It\'s like  reviewing the Murders at the Rue Morgue by lambasting Poe for having had  the monkey do it. Sure, it\'s a silly ending, but it\'s STILL THE DAMN  SURPRISE!  Anyway... good book. Buy it. Since my sister\'s place is in  Nowheresville, Iowa, I had to duck out of dinner early so I could drive  three hours to a 365-days-a-year store in Des Moines to buy the second in  the series. That says a lot.
