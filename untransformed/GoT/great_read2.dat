I bought this book after watching a few episodes on HBO. I read the reviews before hand and was a bit intimidated by them saying it was long and complex. I don\'t normally read fantasy so was hesitant. DO NOT HESITATE, it is an excellent read. It very well written and not a challenging read at all. The different characters are well fleshed out so you get to know them and their motives, the chapters are titled by character so you know instantly which character and storyline the coming chapter is about. I couldn\'t put the book down it was very engrossing and fast going. The book is very life like in that the characters aren\'t all saints or villans but shades of gray, there is also betrayal, incest, unfairness and other unpleasant human behaviors not just this happy fantasy land or all bleak doom and gloom. Also some of the characters you may like may die just as in life. I can\'t wait to read the next book and have now ordered the full series it will always have a place on my shelf.
