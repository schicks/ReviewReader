Two friends urged me to read this book and I will admit that I had a very hard time getting started; the first hundred pages were grueling.  But, I attribute that to a shift in writing style; the style is far removed from what I am used to.  That said, the style places the reader with an individual character for an entire chapter.  The reader is aware of the thoughts and feelings of the character but, frequently, the time and place is slightly different from chapter to chapter.  Time moves with no notation to the reader other than, maybe, remembrances of the character that they are with.Once the characters were formed and I had a grasp of the world, of which detail as with the characters unfolds as the reader gets deeper and deeper in to the book, I found that I couldn\'t put the book down.I borrowed the first book from a friend and now I own A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords and eagerly await A Feast for Crows.This series is not the high fantasy that I expected it to be.  There is no clear quest outlined from the beginning, no Ring to be returned no damsel to save, no particular antagonist, no particular protagonist.  Rather, it is a complex web of intrigue, good intentions gone bad, naivete\', ambition and pure determination.  All well done and deliciously woven into a series that will have you rooting for, sometimes, the bad guy who later turns out to be a good guy and sometimes the good guy who later turns out to be a bad guy.Enjoy!
