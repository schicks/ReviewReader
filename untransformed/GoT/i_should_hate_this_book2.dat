Many of favorite books are works of fantasy, but the genre as a whole suffers from a lack of imagination and originality (ironic, that!), and as a result I read relatively little fantasy.  I picked up TGoT because years ago I read Martin\'s Fevre Dream and liked it (even though I don\'t generally care for vampire novels).  There are many reasons why I should have disliked this book, but mainly: (1)I find needlessly long books distasteful.  I thought, for example, that Eddings\'s original Belgariad would have made a reasonable couple of books, but was much weakened by the dithering about that stretched it to four.  TGoT runs some 800 pages in the pbk edition - for the first volume alone!  (2) I dislike books told from a variety of viewpoints, particularly when the author keeps shifting back and forth from chapter to chapter. Too often this convention attempts to mask weaknesses in characterization or plotting.  Martin tells this story from multiple points of view - about eight, if I remember correctly.  So did I hate the book?  Obviously not, since I rated it a 10!  Length wasn\'t a problem since there is no fat in this novel - every chapter advances at least one of the plots.  The multiple points of view didn\'t bother me in practice because the voices are all distinct, and I became quite fond of several of the characters.  Martin also does several things that I find all too infrequently in fantasy fiction: his characters are not two dimensional, representing "good" or "evil".  They are complex, and believable.  Some of the "good guys" I find rather distasteful, and some of the "bad guys" (one in particular) are among my favorite characters in the book.  Also, Martin presents us with a complicated, twisting plot that depends much more on good old-fashioned political intrigue than the usual trite Dark Power on the rise again (I get _very_ bored with "Sauron Syndrome").  In both his complex characterizations and his Byzantine plotting, Martin\'s TGoT reminds me of some of the best of Glen Cook - although their writing styles otherwise are quite dissimilar.  I cannot remember the last time I reread a book within a few months of finishing it the first time, but I did with this one and found it just as gripping the second time around.
