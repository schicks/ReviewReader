I\'d stopped reading fantasy, for the most part.  Having made a concerted effort in past years to find as much good reading in the the genre as possible, I eventually exhausted what I consider the cannon of the fantasy medium, and was becoming largely disgruntled with the dearth of good writing in the field.  The framework for fantasy--the essential ground level--has been laid, but few people in the past few years have really taken advantage of the medium, especially in the mature reader format.  George R.R. Martin is one of the few exceptions.  His prose is captivating, and his plots fresh.  His characters and content launch essentially from the fairy-tale roots of Tolkien, etc., but he clearly writes for a more sophisticated and adult audience.  He is at times macabre, sometimes sentimental, but he has an incredible gift for characterization surpassed only by his riveting storytelling ability.  I am absolutely, completely raving about the book, buying extra copies to l! oan to my friends.  If you love fantasy, read this book.  If you only read one book a year, make this one it.
