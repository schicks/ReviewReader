A Game of Thrones is a large, sprawling, engaging story about a group of people and how their lives are shaped by power, ambition, treachery, deceit, and murder.  In a land where seasons can last years, Eddard Stark is asked by his good friend King Robert to take a job at that has recently been vacated by Eddard\'s brother-in-law.  Reluctant because he does not like to become involved in royal politics, Eddard nevertheless agrees and moves his family to court.  Eddard quickly learns that his doubts were well founded.  There is more than meets the eye in this job and Eddard soon realizes that his predecessor was investigating areas that could prove very dangerous.  Court life is rife with plots, counter plots and power plays and the Stark family becomes ensnared in situations for which they are woefully unprepared.Meanwhile half way around the world, Viserys and Daenerys, children of the previous king,  are plotting a triumphant return.  They view King Robert as nothing but a usurper and vow to raise an army to smash his kingdom.  Travelling through far-away sun-baked lands, Daenerys finds herself surrounded by strangers who may not have her best interests in mind; a brother whose ambitions may lead her into danger; and a series of events that leave her changed forever.And, while the mere mortals are playing the game of thrones, up in the north, a legend has come to life.  Will they see the danger before it is too late?I invite you to meet Ned, Catelyn, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, Daenerys, Jon and all the rest of the incredibly wonderful characters in this most excellent beginning to what promises to be a most excellent series.Back in 1997, I had just finished reading the most recent installment of Robert Jordan\'s "Wheel of Time" series.  Since that series was far from finished and I was still in an "epic fantasy book" mode, I was desperately casting around for something similar.  I happened across an on-line bboard that was discussing \'A Game of Thrones.\'  The praise was universal and it seemed to fit the bill of what I was looking for. So I found a copy and began to read.  It is only like "Wheel of Time" up to a point.  The similarities with WOT lie in the fact that 1) it is a multi-volume series and 2) it has lots of characters.  The two series are very, very different.  However, I think Jordan fans will really enjoy this bookI was immediately taken in by the atmosphere of the book. It is chock full of symbolism and foreshadowing. But it is also very grounded and down to earth.  This book has quite a large cast of characters.  It is a fully realized world with a history, customs, landscapes, legends and a wide range of people.  Yet, the story is told through the viewpoints of a very small, select number of  characters.  Through their eyes you get to see events unfold.  This has the wonderful effect of not only allowing you to get to know the character whose viewpoint you\'re reading at the time in a very intimate way, but also allows the author to reserve the right to revisit an event through the eyes of another character and thereby give the same event an entire new meaning for the reader.Characters in this book are noble, evil, good, cynical, na\xefve and really, endearingly  flawed.  I have to applaud the author\'s willingness to sacrifice sympathetic characters as well as non-sympathetic ones.  He doesn\'t take the easy route and I think the book is all the richer for it.  I went back to reread this book after having read the 2nd and 3rd book of the series and I am pleased that it has held up beautifully to a reread.  If anything, going back to read it after reading the third book of the series has  made for a richer experience.  This is a maddening, wonderful, heartbreaking, exciting book and I cannot recommend it enough.
