George R.R. Martin\'s "Song of Ice and Fire" is similar to Robert Jordan\'s "Wheel of Time" only in the number of characters, depth of back-story, and shear bulk.  With regard to plot and narrative, they take a totally different tack.Jordan pulls in hundreds of deliberately classical elements, and applies his own distinctive twists and turns, but the result still fits solidly within the expected behavior of standard fantasy.  Rand is the protagonist-hero, the Dark One is the archetypical evil presence, and the obvious outcome is that the boy gets the girl(s) and finally defeats the minions of evil in a final climactic battle.That\'s not really the way SoIaF is working out.  Where Jordan takes standard elements and then customizes them somewhat, Martin sets up all of the standard characters, roles, and props, and then he kills them.  Gruesomely. This leaves the author with a nicely blank canvas on which to develop his own, utterly unpredictable plotlines, and leaves the reader in a state of numbed shock such that any preconceptions and expectations are forcibly suspended.What Martin then chose to populate his tabula rasa would make a Nazi stormtrooper squirm.  Rape, incest, fratricide, pedophilia, rape, infanticide, cannibalism, vivisection, and more rape are bandied about in SoIaF like "channel" and "ta\'veren" are in WOT.  In other words, it\'s a rare chapter that does NOT contain some combination of these and other colorful activities.Had Martin written the Wheel of Time, by the third book, most of the Emond Fielders would be dead, Egwene would be married to Couladin, and the reader would be surprised to find himself in the uncomfortable position of rooting for Eliada in the fight against Shai\'tan.I guess I\'m suggesting that it\'s not really a children\'s fantasy. Structurally, it made me think of Raymond Feist\'s extended Riftwar series with a strong "R" rating.  With regard to overall tone, it left a bitter aftertaste reminiscent of Stephen R. Donaldson\'s Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (which was a great and powerful series, mind you).About halfway through the second book, I decided that if something cheerful didn\'t happen soon, I was just going to quit reading.  Well, a few interesting things did happen, and I suppose I shall pre-order each new volume as well, just to find out where the heck Martin is going with this plot.  But I\'m not sure I\'ll like the answer.
