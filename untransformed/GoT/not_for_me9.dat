Finally I am finished. I knew going into this book that it would be a long epic read. However,I was not prepared for it to feel so long. I knew little about this book from the start, I knew it was a popular series on HBO and so many people (including most of my friends here on goodreads)loved this book. I am not a huge fan of Sci-Fi but I loved the Lord of the Rings, and I really liked stories of knights and dragons so I thought I would give this a try. It was not for me.So I worry about writing this review with it only being 2 stars; because there are people very passionate about this series and I don\'t want to offend anyone. I really tried to like this book, I even started over twice to make sure I didn\'t miss anything when I was really lost a quarter of the way through. I just couldn\'t stay focused on this book. I really should have just wanted to stop reading it, but my stubbornness got the better of me.My issue with this was the fact there were way to many characters to keep track of. It had a few characters that I enjoyed following through the book but for the most part I just didn\'t care about the different story lines after awhile. To me there was way to much description/dialog and not enough action. Over halfway through I finally got to some jousting and evil plotting that pulled me in a bit but sadly it wasn\'t enough to keep me that interested. Towards the end the only reason I was reading it was to just finish. I didn\'t care how it ended or which characters lived or died.I must take time to give credit where it is due. George R.R. Martin is a great writer. He was very detailed (sometimes to a fault), and developed his characters well. I might not have liked them all but the characters I did enjoy following were very well thought out in my opinion. I can understand why people would get so wrapped up in this series because of the characters. I can say that after reading this book I will not be continuing on with the others.
