I really wanted to join the masses in liking this new \'epic fantasy\' series. What, another Tolkien? Yippee! Very sadly not :(.I started the book and embarked upon a miserable journey from the light into the darkness. Honestly I found it so depressing and so sexually disturbing (is incest really what everybody wants?) I began to feel physically sick. I could not get past the fourth chapter. I remember loving the novel Flowers in the Attic - but this left me equally disturbed, as if the author enjoys torturing their character creations.Now, had I gone into the historical fiction section and purchased this book - then yes I would be much better prepared to accept what was coming. This book is not fantasy but much more suited to the realm of historical fiction, perhaps even amongst Arthurian Legend - but I retract that because Arthurian legend tends to be more inspiring, promoting high ideals, chivalry and respect of women (generally speaking).Throwing in a couple of Dragons barely gets it into the fantasy section - why is it not in the historical fiction section? Where is that key element so important to fantasy - MAGIC?? SO far I have found NO magic in this book. Sadly this series continues to dominate the epic fantasy section. The smaller writers barely get a look in anymore.These books immediately reminded of The Tudors TV series - vying for thrones and power, conniving, back stabbing, sex and violence etc... Characters of few moral values to which one can aspire to. Do not expect to loose yourself in a magical world when you buy this book. Make sure you have some comedy to watch afterwards, lol.I thought the book deserved a two star and not a one star because... because... I dunno I\'m looking forward to the TV series now I know what to expect (historical fiction). I liked The Tudors, so I\'ll probably like this. It\'s not the author that\'s bad and it wouldn\'t be nearly so bad if it just didnt dominate the fantasy genre.My first bad review, I feel bad now. I guess it\'s cause I yearn for the light...J*
