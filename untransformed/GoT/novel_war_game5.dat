As an experienced gamer who has tried out a wide range of strategy-oriented products, I have found the Game of Thrones to be an especially strong one (which is fairly surprising given that it was not designed as a stand-alone product but instead grows out of a series of genre novels).  It is a nice game in all of the superficial ways: gorgeous board, sturdy and attractive pieces, strong box in a convenient size to add to shelf and with attractive artwork that would make you proud to have it there.  But what especially impressed me is the overall unity of the design.Most niche board games come with extremely thick manuals filled with idiosyncratic rules to govern every situation.  They may be enjoyable, but they take forever to learn and you generally cannot get non-gamers to invest the time.  We feared this game would be the same, but I sat down with my wife, kids, and a family friend so that we could walk through the manual and we quickly realized that the rules were especially consistent and logical.  Even my 12-year-old daughter picked them up quickly.If you\'re looking for a comparison, I\'d say that among the traditional war games this one most closely resembles Diplomacy, and anyone who has played Diplomacy will find the rules particularly comfortable to learn.  The action choices are similar, and determined in advance in a similar fashion.  Randomness plays little role in battle outcomes.  And, like Diplomacy, the game even permits the addition of a negotiation session as players make non-binding deals with one other.But don\'t take these comparisons too far.  This isn\'t Diplomacy with a new thematic overlay.  It would take too long to go into all the unique features of this game, but I\'ll highlight three big ones:  (1) Different territories offer different resources: Troops, Supplies, Power.  If you also factor in whatever direct military advantage taking a territory might bring, the result is that players must make uncertain choices about which advantages to pursue and when to pursue them.  (2) Players periodically bid for positions of political influence that can help them out later, producing a nice tension between saving your resources vs. investing them in gaining potentially useful advantages.  (3) A group of savages called "wildlings" will attack occasionally, threatening all the players at once.  The rules set up an intriguing collective-action problem: Contribute too much to repelling the invasion, and your rivals will have gained a relative advantage.  Contribute too little and the marauders roam the countryside, killing your people before they return home.Does the game have problems?  We\'ve noticed one: The arrival of troops and supplies is governed by event cards, so sometimes a strategy will be stymied not because of any strategic error but because the needed card stubbornly refuses to pop up.  But, by the odds, that kind of difficulty would only appear in a small percentage of games.Finally, please note that I have not read the George R.R. Martin novels that served as a point of departure for this game.  I cannot testify to its level of success capturing the world depicted in the books, only its success at creating a fun and exciting gaming environment.  At that task the game designers have succeeded brilliantly.
