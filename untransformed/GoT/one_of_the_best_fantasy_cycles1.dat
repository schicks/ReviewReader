As I just stated in the title of this review, this is really one of the best Fantasy books of the last decade. And of all time. If I look at the past, I can only conclude that of the Fantasy series created before, Stephen R. Donaldson can compete with Martin, but compared with Donaldson, it is still Martin who prevails. Roger Zelazny with Amber and Jack Vance with Lyonesse and the Dying Earth also come close. Gormenghast is fine Fantasy Too. Tolkien is another story altogether and towers above these others. So, if you like Fantasy, this is surely a must read.This first book and the follow-ups are realistic and full of depth. The characters are people with emotions and are placed in a newly created world that seems believable to me. The fantasy elements are used sparingly and in the right places and amounts. The whole arsenal of characters is used efficiently and does not cause confusion. I mean to say that all characters are all easily identifiable and readers probably won\'t mistake a character for another. Also, Martin uses the POV to great extent and this works great. As with real people I liked some and disliked others. If one of my favorites proved to be the POV in a certain chapter, My interest increased to high levels, but that is not to say that my interest in the story before and after such chapters diminishes. Certainly not. By no means!These are fantastic books and other reviewers here have written large chunks of information already, so in order not to seem repititious I will soon end this review, but not before saying that all the five-star ratings are deserved.Be warned! Martin does not shy away from death and violence and certain other elements many people in real life also tend to enjoy. Just read his short stories in Sandkings and A Song for Lya and you will quickly see what I mean.Why these books miss prizes is beyond me, but it is clear that SF is higher on the priority list of voters. This is quality reading and deserve much more attention than the abominable books of Robert Jordan and other writers who write worse than you and me. I wrote this review in just a few minutes and it contains more useful information than such writers hope to get together in five pages. This is just my opinion, so ignore these ramblings if you do not agree with me, please.These books are better than the so called mainstream literature that is now published and which is regarded with high esteem and crowds the shelves of bookshops. Well, not all of it is bad. If you haven\'t read this before, be sure to grab a copy of this book the next time you walk in such a shop. Do yourself a favor and Mr. Martin and the publishers. The last should be encouraged to publish such books.Thank you Mr. Martin and happy reading to new readers.
