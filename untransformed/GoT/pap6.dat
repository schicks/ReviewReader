With stacks of books at home and a brand new Kindle not yet out of the box, I found myself on a 10,000-mile flight without a book!  An admired friend of mine had read the entire "A Song of Fire and Ice" series, so I decided to give it a try.  At an airport bookstore I bought the first book of the series, and I soon regretted it.I would place Martin in the same league of pop fiction writers as Grisham and Follett.  His style is flat, wordy, and immature; at least Grisham can weave an intriguing story.Martin\'s characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting.  The good guys never seem to learn, and the bad guys never seem to grow.  The good guys are so stupid, make so many bad decisions, and are so easily duped by every trick, no matter how obvious, I no longer cared if they lived or died.  Fortunately, Martin kills them off nice and fast.I finished the entire book and was relieved when I read the last word.  Unwilling to wade through more of Martin\'s bland writing but mildly curious as to the outcome of the series, I did an Internet search for some brief synopses.  After a few minutes of reading about the second book, I rolled my eyes and went on to something more gainful.  I am grateful that I did not read the entire series.I am sorry that Time magazine proclaimed Martin "America\'s Tolkien."  Is that the best we have to offer?  Sure, Raymond and Richard are Martin\'s middle names, but I begrudge the "R. R." comparison with J. R. R. Tolkien.
