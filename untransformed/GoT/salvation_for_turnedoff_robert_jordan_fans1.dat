Remember how you thought the first three volumes of Robert Jordan\'s Wheel of Time series were so extraordinary? Well, Martin\'s Song of Ice and Fire saga is at least one order of magnitude greater.I read a lot of epic fantasy....and this series is head and shoulders above anything else in the genre.
