This fantasy series is arguably the best I\'ve ever seen.  I\'m just now getting around to writing a review of it, even though I\'ve read it thrice since 1999.  Now, before you say "Ugh, another fanatic!", just look at three major differences (in a genre of worn-out plots and character types, this is a good thing) between this book and others.1. In A Game of Thrones, there is almost no magic.  Some people may see this as a bad thing, but I didn\'t.  Take the Lord of the Rings, for instance; most magic happens off-stage.  In Martin\'s universe, we know it exists (magic does make brief appearances at the beginning and end of Thrones) without having our noses rubbed in it, unlike some *other* authors.  The result is what could almost be a first-hand historical account of medieval intrigue.2. Bad things happen to good people.  Yes, this has been noted by many other commentators, but I think that it\'s worth mentioning again.  Rather than having one omnipotent protagonist, we have a slew of equally interesting characters who each have their own little (and not so little) problems.  And bad things do happen.3. A gray tone of morality permeates the book.  Rather than typecast all of the characters (the Savior and his followers vs. the Destroyer and the Armies of Darkness), Martin has put a giddying amount of time into developing them to ensure that none are as good or evil as they might appear.  Yes, there are megalomaniacs.  Yes, there are folks who fight for truth, justice, and the Westerosi way.  And there are even a couple of jerks in their own right.  But once each is analyzed, we find that none is quite as black or white as they seem.  There is a noble lord who is the very soul of honor and justice...but it is revealed that he has fathered a bastard.If you don\'t believe any of this, read the book.  Trust me, those 800+ pages will seem to melt away as you allow yourself to be enchanted by A Game of Thrones.
