George R.R. Martin hits it big with this book. Simply put, this book is one of the best fantasy books on the market, and maybe always will be. It is that good. What is so great about "Game of Thrones" and "the Song of Ice and Fire" series altogether is that it is such a great break from many of the fantasy series that are out there or emerging.This epic is not about friends traveling the world together. This epic is not about clean tactics and good natured people always winning. It is not about loyalty and heroes winning every time. This book almost seems real, because the characters are so well developed that you actually know what they are going to do before they do it because you know how they think and what their motives/goals are. And if you don\'t know what they are going to do before hand, you can easily justify it afterwards, even if you hate what they did (which will happen quite often). I\'ve never been more surprised by an author in ANY book before reading GRRM.His story is real. Every character wants to win, and the desire to come out on top is real. It\'s so obvious that they will do whatever they have to in order to best their rivals and opponents. Some of the characters are so honorable and so easy to like while others are so dreadful and sinister and so easy to hate. The difference between GRRM and the other fantasy writers out there is that you don\'t know who is the stereotypical "good" and the stereotypical "bad." I still don\'t know who to root for or who I think "deserves" to win.In a lot of modern fantasy the authors make it clear who the winner of the epic battle is going to be in the first book. There are also clear cut moral implications throughout the book that the "good" characters adhere to because they are "good." Not so with GRRM which leaves you with a more true to real-life story.I would recommend this book for anyone, especially those who love fantasy or sci-fi books. If you love the medieval time period then read this book. If you love epic battles that are not always fair and backstabbing like you wouldn\'t believe then this book is for you. There is no way this book will dissappoint you unless you get easily offended by graphic sex and language.Also, don\'t get to attached to any of the characters because you just never know with GRRM if that character is the next to die.One of the best books ever written, and the series only picks up from here. You better have "A Game of Thrones," "a Clash of Kings," and "a Storm of Swords," done by the time his next book comes out.
