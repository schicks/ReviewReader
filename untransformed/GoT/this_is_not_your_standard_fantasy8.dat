I haven\'t read a lot of fantasy but I\'ve read Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, and a couple others. Jordan takes 3 books to tell a story fit for one book. Way, way too much describing without a whole lot of plot movement. Brooks is fun adventure storytelling without very deep characters. George R. R. Martin tells a different story. This is not a book for the kids. There\'s brutal violence, graphic sex, and some naughty words:) Lots of good stuff. If you expect great wizards, magical fairies, and grumpy dwarves on a rollicking adventure, this is not the book for you. This is about family, trust, politics, and war. Like many have said there are no traditional \'good guys\' or \'bad guys\'. Oh there are evil, bad people and there are brave, honorable folks; sometimes they are one and the same. And don\'t be surprised if the \'bad guy\' saves an innocent life while the \'good guy\' takes one.Ok, the good:Characters come alive with Martin\'s wonderful prose yet I never felt bogged down with too much description. You never know who lives and who dies. You will enter the minds of a variety of people including a sharp-witted dwarf, bastard children of rulers, wannabe kings without kingdoms, lords with the weight of the world upon their shoulders, and a young girl with petrified dragon eggs. In other words, there is no central character. This book also keeps a pretty good pace. There is a lot to cover and I felt it was done well.Now the bad:If I had to come up with some negatives, the biggest would probably be the sheer number of characters. In the negative reviews this tended to be an issue. You must have a little patience to get through the first quarter to a third. Many characters have similar names and there are a lot of mindbending factions. This can be very daunting for a new reader. People who also expect a lot of high adventure will be disappointed. This is NOT an adventure novel. The closest I can comparte this novel to is Stephen King\'s "Eyes of the Dragon". There is death and quite a bit of it but this is not a Shannara book. If you are still reading, then you must be interested. Don\'t let the complexity of the book turn you away because you will not be disappointed.
