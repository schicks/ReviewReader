This is an incredibly long book (800 pages ) that drags on and on and on. The author writes well enough, but he must be getting paid by the word, because everything is WAY over described. At one point he spends one and a half pages just describing what some guy is wearing ( armor ). What color his cloak is, what is embroidered on the cloak, what colors the embroidery is, the gold work on his breast plate, what patterns are on the breast plate, a list of every kind of jewel on his breastplate. He describes ( in painful detail ) the guys shoes and his gloves and his helm and his mail and on and on and on, and none of it has anything to do with the story. The whole book is that way. And then there are about two hundred characters in the book.  Each identified once, often times six at a time, then when they pop up a hundred pages later, identified only by name, sometimes first name, sometimes last,sometimes both,you don\'t know who they are, or what significance they have. And when you finally finish the book ( whew ), nothing has really happened.No wonder there are so many more books in the series!
