It\'s very rare that I can make myself type up a review, but in this case, I\'ll make an exception. Because, to be frank, this is the best fantasy novel I\'ve read since Tolkien, and everyone should hear how good it is. I just hope I can give a truly convincing argument for why you should read this book as well.With prose that balances just the right amount of description and narrative flow, Martin introduces you to a world where seasons last for years, noble Houses bid for power and glory, and threats loom from all directions. Each chapter is told from the point of view of a different character; usually, one of the Stark family, whose members provide the moral linchpin of the novel. Through this narrative style, you are gradually introduced into the thoughts and opinions of each chapter\'s guiding character, until you feel that you almost know them. Startlingly enough, even "minor" characters are well fleshed out - there are no flat stereotypes in this novel, and you\'ll soon find that even people like the beastly Hound are more than just cardboard cutouts with "villain" stamped on them.Ultimately, it was the characters more than anything else that made this book for me. Really, I don\'t see how you can fail to love them, or at the very least love to hate them. As many, many other reviewers have said, this is no typical "everybody lives" story. People die, tragically and brutally, but this should not turn you away from the book. If anything, it makes you more attached to the characters than ever; rather than self-confidence ("Harhar, wonder how Mat will get out of THIS one?"), you (or at least _I_) feel real fear for them. Their next misstep could be their last, and that\'s enough to keep anyone on the edge of their seat.This series also features a departure from the "cleanliness" of most "high fantasy", and at the risk of sounding like some sort of an ignorant brute, I mark that a good thing...  Seeing characters actually curse like real people instead of rambling on about "goat-kissing woolheads" was positively delightful in its originality. Although this definitely means that younger readers should beware, Martin\'s unflinching (and mature) approach towards such subject matter should be admired, or at the very least, tolerated.This is most definitely NOT cookie-cutter fantasy (which is enjoyable in its own right). Oh, to be sure, there\'s the usual battling, a touch of magic, and a few otherworldly creatures, but there\'s also a good deal of intrigue and betrayal. The plot twists and turns on itself, always revealing new surprises. The line between good and evil is a blurry one; there is no Sauron or Warlock king or Mad God Torak. There is only the evil that resides in the heart of men and emerges sometimes from the purest of intentions. As I read along, sometimes I felt myself asking the question, "Who should I be supporting? Who\'s really right?" Thank you, George RR Martin, for giving your readers such an interesting struggle.Really, there\'s not much more I can say to recommend this book to you. But, as someone who has read a TON of fantasy - from Tolkien to Eddings, to Brooks, to Jordan to McCaffrey to Bradbury etc. - I can confidently say this is the most refreshing, well-written, and just plain ENTERTAINING work I\'ve come across in recent memory. Enjoy.
