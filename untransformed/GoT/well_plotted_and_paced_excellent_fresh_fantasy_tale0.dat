First off, I\'m a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I\'ve read over a 100 different  fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I\'m now 32). Took about 5  years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and  cliched.  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual:  Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and  man, that was the kicker!  Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I\'ve also listed the reasons not to  choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who  won\'t like this series:  WHY TO READ GRRM  (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats  the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and  all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the  good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the  commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different  . . . you get the idea.  After reading this over and over, it gets old.  (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE  EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this  gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person  comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him  back.  This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die,  but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the  adventure and perished.  (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was  influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED  YEARS WAR.  (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID  OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in  the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the  villain, is stupid or not too bright.  (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND  DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has  the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint.  Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if  you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in  the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly,  GRRM doesn\'t try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He  purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.  (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are  long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces;  something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten  suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we  sometimes get different opinions.  (7) WORDPLAY: if you\'re big on metaphors and description, GRRM is  your guy. Almost flawless flow.  (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between  characters through threats and intrigue.  (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each  character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story  continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why  each novel is between 700-900 pages.  (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical  archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are  totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of  characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book  three.  (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we  can\'t understand it but well done.  (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you\'re big on  that.  (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits;  GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.  (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male  author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think,  too.  (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so  heroes can\'t get out of jams with it.  REASON TO NOT READ GRRM  (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good  job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn\'t  your style, you shouldn\'t be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so  be warned.  (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like  more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or  Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with  strong archetypes.  (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer  that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for  you.  (4) SWEARING, SEX: there\'s a lot of it in this book just as there is in  real life.  (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK:  this isn\'t the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some  have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.  (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can  be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn\'t try to  make anyone necessarily good or evil.  (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it\'s  comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist\'s THE  RIFTWAR SAGA); it\'s familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we\'re  this upcoming, great hero. You wont\' get much of this in GRRM with the  exception of one or two characters.  (8) LENGTH: you don\'t want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that  case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.  (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of  power (one female exception). ....
