I put this book down the first time I attempted to read it simply because the first book had such a triumphant ending that the dark nature of \'Dune Messiah\' just didn\'t work for me.  I had attempted to read this book just  having completed the first one.  My second attempt came two months later  and this time I read it entirely in a matter of days.  I\'m glad I did.  \'Dune\' is an epic in every sense of the word.  \'Dune Messiah\' is anything  but an epic.  It is a singular story dealing mostly with the inherent  problems of religion and politics becoming one.  Paul struggles with the  consequenses of the jihad yet feels powerless to stop it.  He is nothing  more than a figurehead to his Qizara and wants to be free of this and the  burden of prescience.  I don\'t wish to give anything away but this book is  worth reading if only for the fantastic ending.  And by the way, \'Children  of Dune\' is a return to the epic style with which \'Dune\' was written.
