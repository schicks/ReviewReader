If you haven\'t read this because you were put off by the "cult" status of Dune, don\'t be. I delayed reading it for years because I usually avoid cult classics and overhyped books. But the moment I started reading Dune, I was captivated.This book creates an entire world and society (what I love best about sci-fi, when done really well.) And this book has an epic struggle of Good and Evil. The bad guys are really BAD. The good guys are complex, heroic and vulnerable at times. There are plots, sub-plots and counter-plots.Some fascinating concepts are introducted in Dune; an order of women who control breeding of superior human beings and influence politics--the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, human savants who replaced computers when computers were banned from the universe for their "dehumanizing" effect. And the Fremen, a desert people who are fiercer than the trained killer army of the Padishah Emperor.This is the most exciting science fiction book I ever read, and is one of my favorite books of all times. If you haven\'t read it, you are in for a treat. Dune is complicated at times, but always worthwhile.
