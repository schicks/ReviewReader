This was one of the first novels I loved when I first began reading Science Fiction, though today, I would call it Fantasy. After decades I find it less enthralling. The esoteric segues created less tension than a sense of "get on with it". I imagine the fans will be calling for my blood, but themes  or tropes that disappointed me now were 1) the boy saviour who saves the world; 2) the repeated reference to his mother as "old", despite the fact that when the Atriedes landed on Arrakis she was a woman in full bloom, mother of a fifteen year old. After two to three years, she becomes old. She can\'t be more than forty! The world building is great, the Bene Gesserit interesting if implausible, but the characters at times seem more like symbols than people.
