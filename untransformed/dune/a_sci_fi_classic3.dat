I should be ashamed with myself that I have not written a review on this wonderful book until today.  Anyone with an interest in politics or economics will love this book.  Likewise, a reader who enjoys science fiction novels will enjoy this book and the the books following in the series."Dune\'s" ability to pull the reader quickly into a tumultuous time in the novel\'s universe is uncanny.  Picking this book up, even on the first page you\'ll be immersed in the Dune world.  The interjections of quotes from the Princess is a theme Herbert keeps throughout the series, and they offer unique insights into the story to come, the story thus far, or anecdotes that might shed interesting colors on the uniqueness of the characters.Younger readers may find this book to be a tough read, and may miss the more subtle points of the novels interwoven political and economical undertones and the bearings they can have on our world today in our current political climate.  But nonetheless, even younger readers that have an open imagination can easily enjoy the vast sand dunes of Arrakis and all their mysteries.
