Read "Dune" for an absorbing and entertaining story.  Like "Lord of the Rings" and "Stranger in a Strange Land", "Dune" transcends genre classification and can rightly be deemed  a modern classic.I\'m not a big sci-fi fan; I prefer traditional fiction.  When reading sci-fi, I often feel the author\'s insistence that I buy into  his/her thoughts, and this prevents me from becoming involved in the story  itself.  Kind of like watching a student film.Of course,  "Dune" is a product of Frank Herbert\'s mind, but that fact  doesn\'t insinuate itself into the reader\'s mind as the story unfolds.  I  first read this over 20 years ago, and have recently picked it up again.  I\'ve been reading it on the bus to work, at night when I get home - even  though I already know the plot.  It\'s simply good writing.  I agree with  other customer comments below, that the books following "Dune"  fall a bit flat.  Read slowly and enjoy- this one is the best!
