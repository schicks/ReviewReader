There are already 1600 reviews. I don\'t think it\'s necessary for me to even attempt to summarize the plot. Besides, it\'s the WORLD\'S best-selling science fiction novel of all times. I want to stress that the Kindle edition I got two days ago is beautifully edited and identical to the paperbound I read over and over starting in 1973.I was "into" sci-fi in 1973. I was also commuting from my home to San Francisco every day when I started Dune. I loved the book (and at the beginning of each chapter, perhaps a book within the book) so much, that I started meting out my reading of it for commute hours only. That\'s one reason it took me 6 months to finish it. There are times when it\'s good to be a slow reader, and there are times when it\'s great to be able to stretch out something so enjoyable for such a long time.Absolutely fascinating. Unfortunately, I could never get into the other two books in the Dune Trilogy. THIS stands on its own.
