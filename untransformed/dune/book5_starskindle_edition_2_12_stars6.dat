As a piece of science fiction, Dune deserves its place among the best.  Even beyond the sci-fi world this piece of literature ranks among the best books ever written, in my opinion.  Frank Herbert has created a time and place that, while so alien also seems very familiar.  He certainly immerses his readers in the world of Dune and in the politics that surround it.  It\'s too bad that Dune has been categorized as a science fiction novel.  While it most certainly is that it will also appeal to those interested in many other forms of fiction, especially those interested in political intrigue.That said the kindle version is rather dissapointing from the standpoint of all the editorial errors in it.  Misspelled words, missing spaces between words, etc.  At $15 for this e-book, which is way too expensive in my opinion, I expect a book that is professionally edited just like any other edition.  I think Amazon owes everyone who has purchased this edition a newly editted version that fixes all the problems in the original download.
