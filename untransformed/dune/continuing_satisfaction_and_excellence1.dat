As many have noted, this second work veers into an entirely new direction than the first book. Whereas "Dune" reeked of war and heroism and epic events on a grand scale, this one is more intimate, almost inwardly perspective.  It is not in any way a clone of the first novel but a continuation of the story.The operative word is in the title, "Messiah".  Both the first and the second novels are presentations of the hope of almost every ancient civilization: A mighty man of goodness will appear and smite the sinners while elevating the downtrodden. The way this prophecy coincides with the ancient breeding program of the Bene Geseret witches is the heart of the first novel.  Although the author obviously favors Arabic/Islamic motifs, the personal story of Paul is more that of Jesus than Mohammed...the curious birth, the one who does not understand his own mission, the teacher and alas, the one who dies for the sins of the world.Like all Messiahs, the teachings are sublimated as the focus of the cult becomes the person. Despite protests, the object of worship becomes the man himself. Casual sayings are codified into a creed that followers misinterpret or translate to support an existing structure. This path may be inevitable since it is far easier to worship someone that follow their advice. Paul, like Mohammed, excels in bloodshed and his adopted Fremen have conquered the Universe in a Holy War to end all wars. The old adage, "An evil act is justified by its ultimate goal, " plays out repeatedly in this novel.  The Fremen have their Messiah yet nothing really changes, people are still the same inside - only the externals have varied.The palace intrigues are more subtle, the dialogue elevated to a new plane, the philosophical arena larger.  Like Islam, the cult becomes a hereditary institution whose power remains in the family.  Once again, the story of the witches captivates and enthralls and ones attitude toward Paul\'s siter becomes one of pity at her helplessness.This is not an easy book to start out with but a necessary one for the series itself.
