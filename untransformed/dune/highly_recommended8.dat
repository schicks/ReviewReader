I would NOT recommend this UNLESS you\'ve read the the first book in the series. In my mind this book is not as great as the original "Dune," but is extremely well-written, imaginative, inventive,  and does a good job expanding the Dune universe and its mythology. If  you\'re into great sci-fi that intelligently deals with politics, religion,  philosophy, ecology (and other -ologies too numerous to mention), you can\'t  go wrong with the Dune books...
