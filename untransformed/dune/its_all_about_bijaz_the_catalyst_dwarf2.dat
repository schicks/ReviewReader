Probably the most distinct moment of reading Dune Messiah came when my eyes lit upon the wonderful phrase: "Bijaz the catalyst dwarf."  Only in the prose of Frank Herbert could such a coupling be possible.As to Bijaz, himself, I\'m not really sure why he needed to be in the book.  He didn\'t seem to be an essential character, just a peculiar garnish on the storyline.  The Station Agent this ain\'t.I\'m a bit on the fence about this book.  I see the point that some reviewers here are making, that it\'s the tragedy of Paul, but I have a hard time finding his tragedy paramount or even compelling.  As he, himself, says, 35 billion people have died in the holy war he unleashed.  Next to that incredible cataclysm, his own sense of self-pity seems rather piddling, and his own relative inaction inexcusable.The action in Dune Messiah seems more obscure than in its predecessor.  I think a bit too much is left offstage.  Developments seem to conjure themselves out of thin air.  That said, it still leaves the overall storyline on an interesting path and doesn\'t disincline me from reading Children of Dune.
