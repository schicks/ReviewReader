From 1979 to 1984 I read this SF classic three times. Now sixteen years later I\'ve read it for the fourth time. Frank Herbert\'s novel was published in 1965 and is considered to be one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert wrote a series of six Dune novels before his death in 1986. This book, the first and greatest in the series, is a tale of political intrigue and revenge set on the desert planet of Arrakis, commonly known as Dune. The story encompasses religious and ecological themes as well as social upheaval. The wealth of the planet is the geriatric spice known as melange, and Dune is the sole source of the spice. The prescient powers of the spice allow for space travel. The hero of the story, Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides, is caught up in a far-reaching tale of a feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, and a centuries-old scheme of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood to secretly breed a being with mental powers able to bridge space and time.In 1984 David Lynch brought Dune to the big screen with a mixed degree of success. Naturally he had to do some serious trimming of the sprawling novel in order to encapsulate it in a movie. He also made some marked changes to the story. I read this novel again for three reasons: 1) Because it\'s a favorite of mine; 2) as a precursor to watching the Sci-Fi Channel\'s six-hour Dune mini-series; and 3) Frank Herbert\'s son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with seasoned writer Kevin J. Anderson, has written a trilogy of prequels to the Dune saga and I want to have the story fresh in my mind when I read the first of them, DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES.I have read five of the six Dune novels in Frank Herbert\'s series. The second, DUNE MESSIAH continues the story of Paul Atreides, but is otherwise unremarkable. The third, CHILDREN OF DUNE, is a tale with Paul\'s children as the protagonists. The fourth is GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE, and was my least favorite, as it was heavy on philosophy and short on action. The fifth is HERETICS OF DUNE which I barely remember and it is set thousands of years after the events of the first three books. Some liken HERETICS to the style of the first book and I plan on reading it again. The sixth book in the series is called CHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE and purportedly picks up where HERETICS leaves off. I\'ll read it after I finish re-reading HERETICS OF DUNE.A note from the official Dune Novels site: "Shortly before his death, Frank Herbert had begun work on DUNE 7, and he had discussed writing possible future DUNE projects with Brian. Because of the beautiful and moving dedication to Beverly Herbert, Brian\'s mother, in CHAPTERHOUSE, for ten years Brian felt that the story should stop there, even though the last novel ends on a cliffhanger. In 1996, though, two safe deposit boxes were discovered that Frank Herbert had sealed before his death. Inside those boxes, Brian discovered the full and complete outline for DUNE 7, the final DUNE novel Frank Herbert had intended to write, which wraps up all the story threads from the previous six books.Brian and Kevin do intend to write DUNE 7, but it will not be the next project in line. Due to the complexity of the outline, many things need to be established in earlier novels, and it also seems fitting that DUNE 7 should be the last Dune novel published."
