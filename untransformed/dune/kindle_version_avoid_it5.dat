This a review of the KINDLE version!!Today I decided to start reading this book on the train to work. I read mostly on the train or the bus to and from work. I took out my Kindle touch and started to read. I read a couple of pages but it was so noisy on the train so I decided to listen to the audio book instead. It started and when the narrator came to the 2nd paragraph I realized that I hadn\'t read the text he was reading just a couple of minutes before. I took out my kindle again to check and I was right. Now at work I went to this page and looked at the preview of the book vs the kindle version and I saw that the 2nd paragraph of the book was missing from the Kindle version. I am very surprised to see this. I also have the paperback at home (I am in the process of going fully digital on my great Kindle reader). For me, who is a perfectionist when it comes to books and most other stuff (I want to read exactly what the writer and editors have written and published), this is completely unacceptable (what other stuff is missing from the Kindle version I asked myself). I guess I have to take out my paperback to be able to read this book with the full text.So to conclude, AVOID this Kindle version if you want to read what Frank Herbert wrote.
