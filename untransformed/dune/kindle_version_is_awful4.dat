I\'ll start by saying that I LOVE the book Dune and have for years.  The story itself is magnificent and should get five stars.  The only reason I\'m only giving my review one star is because the Kindle version is so full of typos and formatting errors.  I can\'t believe I paid so much (more than a print book!) for a Kindle version that is so appallingly badly edited.If this were a physical book, it would never have made it to the printer.  I can\'t imagine that this version was even proofread.  It\'s distracting and disruptive, and ruins the flow of the story to be correcting things in my head as I read.Awful.  DO NOT buy the Kindle version.  Save your money and buy a $2 used paperback copy.
