Finished my reread of Dune by Frank Herbert.  It still holds up extrememly well--I believe it\'s The Lord of the Rings for science fiction.I won\'t recount the plot here, since there are probably a million reviews of the book and the series, and lots of folks have seen the regrettable David Lynch movie (fortunately for millions of Star Wars fans, Lynch turned down Jedi to direct Dune).  The movie was like looking at something through pavement heat--you can tell what it is that you\'re supposed to be seeing if you can account for the distortion.  But, I\'m biased; I don\'t understand how Lynch continues to get work.But I digress.  There are at least two things about Dune that really make the novel stand out against the background of other science fiction novels:First, the absence of technology.  As part of the backstory of Dune, there was a revolt against computers in humanity\'s past (our future), and they are banned from society.  This plot convention steers Dune away from where many science fiction works crash and burn--an obsession with technology and "technobabble."  Some sci-fi is so tech-heavy that the stories read like stereo instructions.  Sadly, this is a trend which has only gotten worse after the advent of cyberpunk.  Rejecting technology as a crutch allowed Herbert to focus on the humanity of his characters.Second, the story is character-intensive.  The characters a very well developed, and Herbert develops them with an economy that should make other writers envious.  The exposition in Dune is kept to a minimum, which is remarkable considering the tone that Dune possesses.  Almost alone in the genre, Dune has a voice that\'s more akin to Homer, Tolkein, or Arthurian legend.  The story is an epic on a grand scale, with nuanced heroes and villains that lack Homer\'s length (and beauty) or Tolkein\'s ponderous prose.  The way the characters interact with situations, each other, and even within themselves shows Herbert\'s skill as a writer.One helpful note to Dune:  if you\'ve seen the movie, then you know the general idea of the plot.  Go ahead and read the appendices at the back of the book first.  It\'s not great reading, but it will give a little more backstory that\'ll make the book easier to understand.If you haven\'t seen the movie version of Dune, just start the book from the beginning.  The appendices have a few spoilers in them if you\'re new to the story.Dune explores a number of important topics with depth that\'s rarely acheived in science ficiton:  religion, climate change, human nature, life, death, ecology, among many others.  It\'s an outstanding read.
