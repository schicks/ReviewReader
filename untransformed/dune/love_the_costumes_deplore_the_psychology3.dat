Underlying the structure and presentation of Dune are a number of disturbing presumptions.  Together they conspire to make Dune intellectually depressing.  I think very few readers would finish the book feeling "good".  I agree that the effort in imagining the various groups portrayed, their customs, the ecology of Dune and the worms, all this is a magnificent achievement by the author.  However, for me, the psychological world inhabited by his characters was much less varied and much less involving: in what follows I hope to suggest why this was so.The novel\'s world is Machiavellian.  The motivation of virtually every character is a lust for power.  It is a crude lust in that there is no detailed vision of what purpose such power could serve.  Indeed, there is no vision of what constitutes a good life.  Without enemies, the characters lose all direction - if they are not openly fighting each other, then at the very least they must fight the elements, as embodied by the eponymous planet, Dune.  The characters, while differentiated in some ways, share the premiss that the purpose of conversation is to manipulate the interlocutor; practical intelligence is measured by the ability to hide one\'s own intentions, while discovering those hidden by the other party - this secrecy implies that most intentions are intrinsically hostile.  By sharing these assumptions, the characters lose their individuality, and paradoxically their struggles lose their potency, since it is not a clash of opposites (despite the superficial, and very well drawn, differences in dress, background, and supernatural abilities).  Those characters who do not personally engage in such tendentious discussion ally themselves unreflectively with one party or another - and they generally express their allegiance through overt violence - these characters too fail to individuate themselves, all falling into the role of the loyal lackey.  This is a world informed by "The Prince", Nietzsche, and Hobbes.There is little or no scientific curiosity displayed by any character, nor is such curiosity venerated.  It is really a misnomer to term this book science fiction - it has far more in common with medieval fantasy stories.  The disciplines of body and mind at which the central characters excel would not be out of place in an Asian martial arts tale.  Technology is limited and it is a given - what is mentioned has the status of an artisan craft, such as the Fremen skills in manufacturing clothing.  Knowledge comes from revelation, or is passed from generation to generation - it is not earned through rational enquiry and experimental method.Similarly, the arts are at best sources of brief diversion.  As a token, the man Halleck strums a stringed instrument and recites appalling poetry.  Aside from him virtually no mention is made of literature, the visual arts, music, or philosophy.Blood ties win out over any more universal sense of morality.  Allied to this are themes of overt eugenics.  This ugly emphasis on genes and family loyalties speaks of the tale\'s respect for, if not implicit endorsement of, social Darwinism - a theory dangerous in its rampant oversimplification of real society.  It is the kind of thinking which recalls that of the Nazis.Religion is dealt with in a dismissive way. Yes, there is the appropriation of many terms from Islam, and the depiction of rituals borrows from Christianity and elsewhere, but all this is implied to be a means to an end.  The Bene Gesserit "Sisterhood" implant legends, religious in flavour, so as to facilitate their "breeding program".  Paul looks to his status as deity as a means to secure political power, and to inspire violence (which becomes uncontrollable, and this lack of control he admittedly regrets up to a point).  This is a very instrumental and cynical view of religion.  It very much neglects a more general sense of wonder and amazement at our existence which, more optimistically, fills the spirit of religion.The protagonist Paul Atreides is horribly solipsistic.  Ok, so he\'s the Messiah, but he doesn\'t have to believe his own publicity.  He can see the future, but he has great trouble empathizing with anyone - compared with his overarching ambitions, the lives and desires of others seem at best trivial, and at worst invisible.  This solipsism is married to a kind of determinism, or, if you like, fatalism - in making decisions he has a very limited choice, and the making at times feels more like the toss of the coin than a willed act.  Possibly Herbert had read Sartre and was impressed by the Existentialist notion of radical choice - Sartre writes of a being attaining Messianic status, or perfection, and being faced with only one last authentic choice: that of self-annihilation.  This is truly a bleak vision, and one deeply disrespectful of the reality of other lives and the interconnectednes of them too.Unsurprisingly, given all the above presumptions, the world of Dune is unremmittingly humourless.  There is deadly earnestness  hanging over everything.  Life is nasty, brutish, and tediously prolonged.  It\'s a shame that a movie version of this wasn\'t made in the 60\'s, directed by Jonathan Miller, with Dudley Moore as Paul, and Peter Cook as Stilgar; Peter Sellars would make an outstanding Jessica, and possibly Peter Ustinov could be stuffed into a worm-suit...having finished reading this book the two things I imagine most readers would need would be a glass of water and a good laugh.
