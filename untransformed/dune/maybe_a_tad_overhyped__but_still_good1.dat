There are a lot of new terms in dune. So many infact its kind of annoying. The universe crafted certainly is detailed. I can see why this franchise is so beloved.  I didn\'t really have a favorite character to get behind except for maybe that Liet guy but he isn\'t that big in the story. While I did not fall in love I do plan on following along with this series sometime down the road.
