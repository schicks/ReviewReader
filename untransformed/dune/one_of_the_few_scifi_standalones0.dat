How often do you find a book of moderate length with original and complex characters, set in a compelling historical and physical context, that has a complete story arch that lets you close the book satisfied?  Infrequently, especially in the world of Sci-Fi. It is the accomplishment of all of these that allows "Dune" -- if not its sequels -- to hold its own among all the great stories of our time. Many others here have written about Herbert\'s brilliant character development and his incredible creativity in conceiving the world of "Dune".  I would like to call your attention, though, to the satisfaction that comes from reading a well thought out story that is told deftly and with passion.  All too often in Science Fiction (and non-Sci Fi for that matter) we see books premised on a few ideas that go nowhere as a story.  Authors have very original ideas that suck us into the book, tease us along for a while, and then end the story with a fizzle, dragging us into a morass of over-wrought characters and needlessly complicated plot-lines.  Neal Stephenson\'s "The Diamond Age" is a perfect example.  Your feeling after the first 50 pages is, "What a cool idea! This is great!"  But the book ends up taking you on a long, slow downhill ride with an ending that is nowhere close to the brilliance of the original concept."Dune" does not do this.  It lifts you gently into the main story, making sure to point out the relevant characters and side-plots as you go along, builds your anticipation over its entirety, and continually keeps you fresh and interested.  The resolution is complete and timely, and doesn\'t leave you slogging through 20 meaningless pages at the end.  When you finish, you can look back and say, "What a great story, and what a great storyteller."I believe the goal of all fiction should be to make readers say that, and with "Dune" Frank Herbert has definitely made me say it.
