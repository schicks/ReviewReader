**** This is a quick note about the Kindle edition of Dune called "Dune (40th Anniversary Edition)".  Amazon and the publisher should be ashamed to be marketing this Kindle version with so many misspellings.  This is one of the top classic Science Fiction titles of all time.  I am here to tell you to that this Kindle edition is not worthy of your funds.  I could excuse a couple of errors in the book, but the Kindle edition is **RIFE** with them.  A major Kindle  disappointment that I will not soon forget.  I have purchased *many* other Kindle books and witnessed misspellings, but was able to forgive due to infrequency and more obscure book titles.  But to see so many misspellings in such a renown title was rather disgusting.  I had planned to buy the other Dune books on Kindle but will not do so now, solely due to this issue.  I have better ways of spending ~$40 than to spend it on products that evidently the publisher and seller care nothing about.  Can\'t express in words just how angry I was to see this book given this treatment.  One final note, I saw another post that said the Kindle edition had the same misspellings as the original book.  I have no idea what Kindle edition this person was comparing to what print edition, but I am here to tell you that this is NOT the case with this Kindle edition.  The misspellings in this Kindle edition are NUMEROUS, GROSS in their error, and DO NOT match the paperback book I own of the same title  (I have Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback - the multitude of errors I checked are not found in this print edition).As for the book itself, what is there to say that has not already been said?  THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.  If you love Science Fiction, and have not read this book, then you do not know Science Fiction.  Get it, read it, enjoy.5 Stars for Frank Herbert and Dune1 Star for Amazon and Penquin Group.
