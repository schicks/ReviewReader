Dune (1965) is the first SF novel in this series.  Paul Atreides was born to Duke Leto Atreides and the Lady Jessica in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor Shaddim IV.  For his first fifteen years, Paul lived on Caladan, the Atreides home planet.  Then the Emperor exchanged Arrakis -- Dune -- for Caladan.In this novel, Duke Leto is a leader of men and sees Arrakis as an opportunity to expose the former possessors -- the Harkonnens -- as incompetents.  Arrakis is the only planet that produces Melange, popularly known as Spice.  The substance allows Guild Navigators to guide ships between the stars and extends the life of any who can afford it.Duke Leto also sees a great opportunity in the Fremen, the dwellers of the Arrakis desert.  The Harkonnens have hunted the Fremen for sport and consider them to be native trash.  But the Duke knows that the Fremen are potentially as deadly as the most elite force within the Empire, the Sardaukar.The Duke and his retainers are preparing for the move.  Yet Paul is being prepared for something else.  Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam has come to Caladan to test him with the gom jabbar.The Bene Gesserit have been breeding for a Kwisatz Haderach, a person with unusual talents and a strange destiny.  The first step in testing for such a person is the gom jabbar, the test of pain.  When Paul inserts his hand into the box, he fells as if his hand is being burned to a blackened stump.His mother Jessica knows that he will be subjected to extreme pain, but she doesn\'t question the need.  She has been trained by the Bene Gesserit and accepts their goals.  Yet she was ordered to produce a girl child and she is not quite certain why she had disobeyed.Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sees the turnover of Arrakis as an opportunity to destroy Duke Leto.  He and Piter -- his Mentat -- brief his nephew Feyd-Rautha on the plan.  But the Baron and his Mentat can\'t converse without bickering.  Feyd-Rautha would rather be elsewhere than to witness their quarreling.Wellington Yueh is a Suk Doctor in the household of Duke Leto.  The Baron Harkonnen has captured His wife Wanda and is pressing the doctor to kidnap Paul.  The doctor has convenient access to Paul and is trusted by the Atreides.In this story, the Atreides take their household and possessions to Arrakis on a Guild freighter.  Rather than occupying Carthage -- the former Harkonnen capitol -- the Atreides land in Arrakeen, which  Thufir Hawat -- the Duke\'s Mentat -- has decided is more defensible.  The Atreides family resides in the household of Count Hasimir Fenring.The Atreides contact the Fremen and learn of a Harkonnen force disguised as Fremen.  Duncan Idaho and his men take the Harkonnens captive, but the Harkonnens severely wound the Fremen courier.  He dies in transit to the Atreides medical facility.Stilgar -- chief of a Fremen sietch -- comes to Leto to evaluate him.  He honors Leto enough to give him permission to unsheath a crysknife found near the courier.  Duke Leto then gives Duncan Idaho leave to return to the sietch with Stilgar.This story tells of the death of Duke Leto and the transfer of loyalty of his men to Paul.  It takes Paul to the Fremen and makes him one of them.  It lays the foundations of the fall of the Empire and the rise of the God-King.This novel is only the first of a great series.  It creates a very fascinating universe that is still being read and expanded.  It may be the best of the author\'s works, if only for its great scope and backstory.Highly recommended for Herbert fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exotic societies, political intrigue and strange powers.-Arthur W.
