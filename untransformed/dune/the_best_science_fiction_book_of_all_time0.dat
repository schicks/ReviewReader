Dune is set in a harsh environment, not only ecologically, but politcally and socially, with a perfect dash of religion thrown in as well.  It follows Paul Muad\'dib through his route as a boy to his becoming of a great messiah -- the "hand of God".With a great set of characters like the Baron Harkonnen, extremely to the side of sadism and sadistic thoughts, to the Fremen, a native people of loyalty and strength compared only by the way death accompanies life, to Duke Leto Atreides, an honorable man of strength and leadership.  The characters, alone, are perfectly blended to make the novel of the century -- if not all time. Frank Herbert has defeated all chances of being beaten in writing skill, with his wonderful way of explaining various physical and mental items through the use of little words and much of the readers imagination, as well as a wonderfully bound together plot which will draw you further into the story as you go along. The first of six novels in the Dune Chronicles, it is also the best of them all, but not the best alone.  If you read this novel, then you\'d probably want to read the next five in the chronicles, as the experience, as good as it is in Dune, cannot be fully expressed without the completion of the series. I\'d give this book a higher rating, if it were permitted.
