I read Dune over three years ago, and naturally I loved it.  When I tried to read Dune Messiah I couldn\'t, I found it boring, and felt that the main character was now too old. Recently, I reread Dune and continued on  through to Dune Messiah, reading both in only two weeks. Dune Messiah  is really just a continuation of the first, and it delivers a \'triumphant  tragedy\' that is makes a fitting end to the life of a Messiah. Paul is  thirty now (not very old at all), and the Jihad he feared so much is  serving the purpose it is supposed to, mingling the genes of humanity and  ending the stagnation that existing under the old Imperial system.  He has  been made both an Emporer and a God, and Alia leads his religion.  Pilgrims  come in their thousands to Arrakis to experience his Holyness. However,  there are many who plot against him.  The Bene Gesserit wish to destroy  Paul before he has the chance to establish an Atreides dynasty and regain  the precious genes they worked so hard to create.  The Fremen long for the  old ways when water was precious and Arrakis was theirs.  The Bene Tleilax  want to gain a kwisatz haderach they can control, and the priests of  Maud\'Dib\'s own religion wish to make a martyr of him. And with his  prescience, Paul sees disaster for all man kind unless he follows one set  path of the future, but is he willing to pay the price that comes with that  future? The plots that surround Paul are intriguing in their own right,  but more intriguing is the development of Paul himself.  Or rather, Paul\'s  realisation that what he has created leads to its own stagnation.  His  powers also develop somewhat, making him an even more realistic Messiah,  and finally, it ends in what is in many ways a tragedy, I certainly left  this book feeling sad, but it is also in many ways a triumph. I do not  feel that this revelation spoils the book, because it could be sumised  because of the Messianic nature of Paul, and because from the very begining  of this book, all paths lead to a tragedy in one form or another. Once  I got over the initial depression, I realised that this book perfected the  Messiah story begun in Dune, and together they make one of the best works  of literature ever.  I feel that the two must be considered as one story.
