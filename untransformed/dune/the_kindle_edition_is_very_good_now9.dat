I have read Dune many times, so I am very familiar with the text.  I am also annoyingly good at noticing typos and other errors.  I just finished reading the Kindle edition of Dune and I did not notice a single error.  It appears that the quality issues that are raised by the currently most helpful review have been resolved. Next up, Dune Messiah.Edit:  OK, it looks like the reviews for the Kindle editions of Dune, Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune are all combined, so I can\'t provide separate reviews.  So here\'s what I found:In Dune Messiah, I noticed a total of five errors.  They generally consisted of hyphens in the middle of words, or extra spaces in the middle of words.In Children if Dune, I noticed a similar number of hyphenation or word spacing errors.  At the end of the book, there was a rash of improper line breaks or quotation endings -- perhaps four of them.I consider all three books to be perfectly readable in their current form.  Personally, I do not regret buying the Kindle editions.
