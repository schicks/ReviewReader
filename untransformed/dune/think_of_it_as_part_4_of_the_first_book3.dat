The first time a read Dune: Messiah I was more than a little disappointed.  By when I re-read Dune I also re-read Dune: Messiah.  This was the first time I\'d read them back-to-back, and I realized that Dune: Messiah was  actually the conclusion to Dune and not a seperate book.  As a stand alone  book it\'s barely passable, as a sequal it\'s worth 3-stars, but as the  fourth part of the first book it\'s a perfect conclusion.  Dune was divided  into 3 parts (called books) and the last ends with a nice Hollywood ending.  Dune: Messiah shows the real conclusion to Paul\'s Life and the real  consequences of his actions in the rest of the book.  I think Herbert had  to end the first book with Paul on top of the Universe because that is what  reader\'s want, but Messsiah is a more somber look at what it means to have  power. After I had re-read Dune and Dune: Messiah, I came across used cliff  notes for Dune, and I noticed that it had an essay which treated to two  books as one and compared them to a Greek epic pointing out that Greek  epics didn\'t end when the hero was on top, but continued to the end of the  hero\'s life.  With the inclusion of Dune: Messiah, Dune now tells us the  complete story of Paul\'s life, and what an incredible story it is. Do not  read this book, rather read Dune and this book together.
