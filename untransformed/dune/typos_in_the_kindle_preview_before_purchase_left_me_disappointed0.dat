After seeing typo complaints about the Kindle edition, I decided to look at the free initial chapters before plunking down that much $$. It didn\'t take me long: \'...he was bom on Caladan..." in the 5th sentence of Book One! Come on Penguin (and Amazon), either significantly reduce the price or get it right (and do the 40th Anniversary proud). Why not give the first reporter of each typo $1 credit and then fix them. I was hoping to reread the entire Dune saga (this time on the Kindle 3 when it becomes available). Now I think I\'ll just dig out my original hard-covers instead. Very disappointed!
