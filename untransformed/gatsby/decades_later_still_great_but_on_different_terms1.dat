Having reread this book for the first time in 20 years, I can confirm that there\'s a reason that it\'s considered one of the very best American novels. However, my reaction to the story was different than when I first read it in high school. I recall that back then I was hoping that Daisy and Gatsby\'s love story would ultimately yield a happy ending. Now, I found them both to be such shallow creatures that they inspired no pity. While I considered the characters to be emotionally stunted, that dooesn\'t mean I was not impressed with Fitzergerald\'s skillful rendering. As in most forms of art, in literature it is more difficult to accurately and interestingly portray nothingness than to describe a richly endowed subject. At this more cynical age, I found Daisy to be a remarkable emotional void, and Gatsby\'s quest to pour all of his hopes and dreams into such a shallow cauldron only confirmed his own vapidity. One thing that hasn\'t changed in all these years is my amazement at Fitzgerald\'s ability to set a scene. His descriptive passages are truly poetic, and his command of word choice in unparalleled. All this made for a stimulating and delightful read.
