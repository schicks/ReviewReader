Personally this is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later.  I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be.  Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).Everyone\'s life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon\'s success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim\'s notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being).  Even Myrtle\'s sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister\'s death.  All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched.  Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known.  Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies.  Does this make him a liar, or worse.Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920\'s America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs.  Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them.  Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact.  While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy\'s wealth allows them to do.Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don\'t know.  Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier.  Better than the whole lot he states.  But can some who is completely a fabrication be great?  The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don\'t know about Gatsby.Enjoy the book.  It\'s a great read that has multiple layers.
