I loved the writing, but I have trouble saying "I love" a book, when it is so incredibly sad.  It is a commentary on the destruction of people who come to love their money...and the destruction great wealth can cause to others.  I am not one who believes that the "rich" are the bad guys.  It is not "money" that is the root of all evil, but rather "the love of money"...this book makes that painfully clear.
