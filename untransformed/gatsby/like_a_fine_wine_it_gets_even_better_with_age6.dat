I\'m troubled that many young people in these reviews don\'t seem to appreciate this novel.  Even when "forced" to read it in high school, I loved it.  I\'ve read it for probably the tenth time recently and I can say that every single time it\'s better than I remembered it.  I was prompted by the character is Haruki Murakami\'s book Norwegian Wood who carries it with him and reads it to cheer him up.  This narrator calls it the most perfect book ever written and says that you cannot find a page that\'s not perfect. I have to agree -- it\'s not just the plot, it\'s the beautiful writing and incredible characters and scenes that stay with you years later.  Even after years, who can forget the scene when Gatsby shows Nick all his custom made shirts, or Nick describes his first vision of Daisy by comparing her posture to someone balancing something on his/her chin, or any of Gatsby\'s parties, or the broken nose -- you get the idea.  For some reason, rereading this book reminds me of picking up a relationshp with an old friend.  It\'s so very comforting to read the best prose you can find in English and find that certain passages are almost committed to memory.  Don\'t miss out on this one.  If you didn\'t like it in high school, try it again when your reading tastes mature.
