It\'s what\'s not written and the hidden, subtle meanings between the lines and the potent reaction of the reader that makes this book one of the classics of American Literature, that and Fitzgerald\'s elegant, almost dance-like, symbolic and deep prose; yes, many might react surprisingly at the word "deep" to describe The Great Gatsby, but many simply did not see that- in portraying the shallowness of the characters, the fast-paced 1920\'s eastern life of the rich and notorious, and the struggles of one man-Gatsby-to rise above his past and ancestry and misplacing his meaning in life to one, undeserved woman-a well-hidden depth of meaning and understanding of what mankind should strive for and unfortunately what most miss was clearly pointed out in the novel.As I read other reviews, I concluded that many misunderstood this novel and it took a Kid Review to understand the main theme of the book: as we try to look into the future-be it for our ambitions, fulfillment, happiness, or love- and turn our dreams into realities-as Gatsby so desperately strived for-you are forever thrown back into your past that has been forgotten by many, for your past shapes the paths you take, your past and past decisions leave their marks and has often dire consequences on your present and future life. It is a message to be cautious and savor yesterday so that you do not fall and regret tomorrow. It is in this essence that Gatsby stood out from the others in the story and met a tragic fate at the hands of the careless, shallow, rich and the confused. Who Gatsby was, his flaws, and misplaced love fore Daisy was of no consequence, that was not Fitzgerald\'s point and many missed it by looking solely at the plot and shallow characterizations and dialogue.While Fitzgerald pointed out many obvious human traits-snobbery, excessive romanticism, carelessness of others\' feelings, betrayal, and the shallow curiosity of other people\'s dramas, as well as the social discrepancies between the rich and the poor scornfully and with distaste, he was barely skimming through the true meaning of his novel.It was not a coincidence that the first 3 settings of the novel mirrored the last 3 settings of the story, in which the past meets the present and affects the future of every main character. The mirror image of the beginning and end of the novel closes the dramas that had unfolded so successfully and so unexpectedly you have to give pause, and with awe come to appreciate the genius of the writingAnd if that still leaves you confounded of what had just happened, it is in the first 2 pages and in the last 2 pages that Fitzgerald bluntly  voices what he truly desires for the reader to understand.Anyone giving this novel a bad review simply did not understand it.
