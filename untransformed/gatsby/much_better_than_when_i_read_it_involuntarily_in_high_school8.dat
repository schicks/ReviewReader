This isn\'t the first time I\'ve read The Great Gatsby. I read it inhigh school, absorbed as much as I needed to pass the class, andI remembered only as much as cultural references reinforced.I decided to read the book again in preparation for seeing thelatest Hollywood version. I haven\'t seen the movie yet, but I\'mglad I read the book.In high school, I didn\'t have the patience, the resources, or theability to fully appreciate the assignment. I\'m sure I had plentyof time, but I wasn\'t about to spend any more of it thanabsolutely necessary on a then 40-year-old story, even though Ilived on Long Island and had actually been to Great Neck.Patience was always in short supply when it came to schoolwork, but I was reading it voluntarily now, and I gave it theeffort it deserved. I looked up every word I didn\'t recognize, andresearched every reference I didn\'t understand. Language,culture, and society have changed quite a bit in 90 years, so Ispent a lot of time on the Internet while I was reading. Eachchapter took at least an hour. But it was all worth it.I\'d give the book six stars, if I could. But I invested much moretime in this slim volume than most people would be willingdevote to it. What if I hadn\'t looked everything up? I\'m prettysure my review would be unchanged. Most of my researchmerely confirmed what I had guessed, and most of what Icouldn\'t guess was of no consequence. Everything in the bookwas there for a reason, but the story is strong enough towithstand a casual reading. In retrospect, I see it was strongenough to withstand a casual and careless reading by a highschool student. How else can I explain the desire to read itagain? I could have just seen the movie.I will see the movie, although I wonder how well it will hold upin comparison to the book. My poor wife will have to deal withmy movie review -- possibly during the movie.
