I had not read this novel for some 20 years, remembering it only as an excellent American novel.  A recent rereading was a revelation--this is indeed one of the world\'s great novels, as close to perfection as the art of fiction comes.  The minor character point of view gave the characters and the action the truth of objectivity. The characterization framed the characters, though not extensively developed, vividly within the parameters of the theme: Gatsby\'s and our nation\'s loss of innocence and the loss of our ideals in the pursuit of wealth.  Though set in the 1920\'s, the novel\'s message is as relevant now as it was then, perhaps in the dedication to greed today even more so.  There is an economy of action in this short novel that Fitzgerald distills into the very essence of what he needs to deliver his message: James Gatz of North Dakota is the embodiment of the American dream, callow, superficial, idealistic, noble and grand--the symbol of this nation\'s promise of the better life, and how it has become corrupted into a glorious and empty dream.  Few novels, in their rapid progression from beginning to conclusion, cause the reader to become aware of the quality of the writing itself, the choice of words, the descriptive details, the to and fro of prose rhythms.  "Gatsby" does on almost every page: "Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness  of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver,safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor." Daisy:"Her voice is full of money....."  That was it.  I\'d never understood before.  It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals\' song of it...high in a white palace the king\'s daughter,the golden girl..." Nick Carraway\'s;" I\'m thirty," I said.  I\'m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."  The last 3 paragraphs of the book are simply magnificent, an eloquent, powerful, gloriously appropriate conclusion to a great novel.  Trying to say how good this novel really is, is like trying to tell your sweetheart how much you love her--words are simply not enough, inadequate and flimsy  intimations of the enormity of the task.
