To me this is literary perfection. It is the only book I know of that is complete: not a word should be cut, or added. It has a palpable mood in which the reader in engulfed: decadence, melancholy, longing, hope, failures, dreams, and an unflinching striving for something purer in a world that wants to drag us into its arrogant and indifferent corruption. Gatsby is THE romantic hero, and Nick the sensitive observer on whom the moral foundation of the book rests. The symbolism is simple and works unobtrusively. I love this book and have read it several times now. It is like a great painting or scene that holds in its smallest details the universal design or chaos if that be the paradox.Reading some of the reviews I find people\'s opinions varying greatly. Some very intelligent people dislike it, even hate it while others love it, or think it good. The same can be said of not so intelligent people. As Nick puts it: "I was within and witout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexaustible variety of life."Do not be too greatly influenced by reviews or the book\'s reputation, simply read it and decide for yourself. In the end considering how short the novel is, how accessible, and if nothing else(I personally think it is much more) a literary phenomenom, it is worth reading for anyone interested in novels and literature
