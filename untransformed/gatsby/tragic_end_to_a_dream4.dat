This is the second time I\'ve read this book and it\'s gone up a full two stars in my estimation. It\'s about ten years since my first reading and I can\'t remember why I didn\'t like it back then, but it may have had something to do with the fact that it\'s quite a depressing story.Now I appreciate the subtleties of it a bit more and I can see that it\'s an attack on the concept of the American dream which Jay Gatsby buys into hook, line and sinker. My interpretation was helped by a review I read of Baz Luhrmann\'s film. Sadly it seems Luhrmann has been as seduced by the glitz and glamour as Gatsby himself and missed the whole point of the story, but I digress.Daisy represents the world of wealth and privilege Gatsby desperately wants to be part of, and he thinks that if he can possess her then he will have fulfilled his heart\'s desire (it reminds me a lot of Henry James\' The American in this sense). Never mind that Daisy is shallow, frivolous and spoilt, because it\'s not really the woman he loves, and he makes this clear when he tells Nick her voice sounds like money. She is the first truly wealthy person he has come in close contact with and her money casts a spell over him that leads to his undoing.Gatsby sells his soul to make enough money to win Daisy over and the extent of his corruption and naivet\xe9 is tragically clear at the end when none of the people who were so happy to partake of his hospitality can be bothered attending his funeral. Daisy doesn\'t even call or send flowers. Gatsby is just collateral damage to them, a victim of the selfish, ruthless world he yearned to be a part of.The writing in the book is deceptively simple because it\'s poetic and even enchanting at times in its descriptions. He captures the essence of the jazz era so well that I felt like I was at the boozy parties, breathing the smoky air and watching everyone get drunker and more debauched. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it\'s made me want to go back and re-read some of the books I\'ve dismissed in the past because your perspective can change dramatically over time.
