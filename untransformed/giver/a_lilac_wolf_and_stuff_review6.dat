Seriously great book!  I just read this as an adult, and the only thing that bums me out is that I didn\'t discover this sooner.  Librarians - why didn\'t you tell me????  I tore through this on my own, then bought it to read to my son.  He\'s only 8 and he loved every moment of it too.  It really led to lots of discussion about this world and why they did things they way they do.  There is just a passing glance of budding sexuality, but it does go into death and war.  Make sure you are ready to hit the heavy topics if you read to your kid - or just wait until they are older.  For older children and adults, great choice.  Definitely read this before watching the movie!
