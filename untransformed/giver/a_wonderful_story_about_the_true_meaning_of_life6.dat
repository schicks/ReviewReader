I absolutely adore this story. I read it for the first time when I was 12 and I just read it again as I am about to give it to a group of girls I tutor. This book has some wonderful things to say about the beauty of life and the dangers of conformity. I would recommend it to anyone 11 or above because there are some things in it that may be a little too emotionally taxing for younger readers.
