The Giver was amazing!  It was about a boy named Jonas who lives in a community of Sameness.  Where everything is the same and safe.  Nobody has to worry about emotional pain.  Everything was perfect until the Ceremony of 12.  That\'s when everybody in his age group was assigned an assignment.  When the Chief Elder skipped Jonas the crowd became uneasy.  They paid attention to the rest of the assignments but were still anxious about Jonas.  After the last assignment the Chief Elder announced a selection.  Jonas was selected to be the reciever, the most honored job in the community.  Jonas starts his training and experiences pain, joy, and even more in depth feelings.  Things he\'s never felt before.I finished this book in 2 days.  That means it was a very good book. (And it earned me an A in reading)  Recently our Reading teacher read aloud Gathering Blue which, like The Giver, was set in the future.  This book was much easier to tell though because of the memories, having technology, and because of the animals.  Also they were alike because Lois Lowery left you hanging at the end.  She wanted you to have imagination and figure out the ending on the own.  And I still wonder if the boy with light eyes in Gathering Blue is Jonas or not.Overall this book was excellent!
