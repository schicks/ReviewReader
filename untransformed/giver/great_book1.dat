full of letters from the 1st page to the last page. Amazing letter size and color, all letters are black on white background. Especially surprised was I when I read page 17, 24, 29, 44, 48 and 191, these are the best pages in this book and just blew mi mind. So if you are in a hurry read them first. I bought this book for a guy I don\'t like and will glue these pages together.
