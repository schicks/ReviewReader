The Giver had an interesting concept, however as the book progressed it became less clear how the Giver and the Receiver kept what they had from the rest of the community.  I kept looking forward to some sort of satisfactory conclusion, even to the point of starting the next book in the series, which appears to share neither the characters nor setting of The Giver.  This first book left me with the feeling of a cruel and selfish society which were, as a whole, untouched by the richness of what makes life worth living.  Then the ending felt like a death of hope, which was further emphasized by the start of the 2nd book.This is a strange fantasy book, without a positive resolution to the issues raised.
