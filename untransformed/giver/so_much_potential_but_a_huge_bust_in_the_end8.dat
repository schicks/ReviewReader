This book immediately captivates you and puts you inside of a world unlike what we know.  It was a real page turner at first.  But, there were some things that I feel should have been better explained to make the story feel more real.  For example, that author didn\'t explain HOW the people were unable to see color or HOW all hills were removed.  About 3/4 of the way done, I realized that the end of the book was rapidly approaching and wondered how it would end.  Well, it seems the author got a little bored and just decided to end it.  The ending was terrible. TERRIBLE.  This book had so much potential and the storyline itself was interesting.  I really wish the author would have made the book longer and added an ending that would have made sense.
