I absolutely loved this book... up until the last few chapters. It all started going downhill once Jonas and the Giver began planning their ridiculous solution to their society\'s problems. It was rushed--the ending of the book and the plan as well. Maybe I\'m just a firm believer that words should be more powerful than memories being magically transmitted to the community. Honestly, this entire book would have been better if magic wasn\'t a part of it. I really didn\'t mind it at first, though I had expected the memories to be given through stories rather than being experienced by Jonas. It would\'ve been much more powerful if they instead talked of humanities horrors and wonders, and then shared their knowledge and wisdom with the community. Really, the magic was not even so bad to begin with, but the ending just completely took advantage of it. There was no depth left in the story by the end of it, not like it ever had too much. I was so disappointed in the ending of what could have been a great book.
