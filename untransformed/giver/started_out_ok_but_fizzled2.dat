Required reading by the students at a Middle School where I teach.  I decided to read it in order to better assist the special needs students I work with.  I wanted to help them understand and I also wanted to be able to answer their questions.  The story starts out like any good plot should, but at some point about two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through, you reach a point where you realize that the author must have stopped writing for a considerable period and when she resumed, she had lost her original train of thought and went off on a completely illogical tangent that leads, ultimately, to a fizzled downer of an ending that seems to have been as others have said, a rush job to make it in time to the publishers.  The question that I pose to all students who read it is, "If you could re-write the ending of this book, how would you end it?"  The responses are remarkably insightful, despite their middle school ages.
