While "The Giver" is a classic book, this edition of Lowry\'s work makes it even more valuable.  The addendum includes Lowry\'s Newbery Award Acceptance speech, so that readers have insight into how and why she wrote the book.  Additionally, there are short stories that connect with the ideas of "The Giver," a non-fiction piece about the role of the "Griot" in Senegal and two fabulous poems that connect thematically.  Having this book will enhance the knowledge of any reader:  teen, teacher, homeschooler. . .this is truly the kind of edition I would like to see for more books commonly taught to teens. As a former teacher, I feel that the more connections a book can make with other literature and other experiences, the more valuable and permanent it becomes to the student.
