The Giver is about a community that has no pain, no wars, and no hunger. Sounds like a perfect community, right? Actually, the community also has no feelings, assigned jobs, spouses, and number per kid. The community also lacks color and music. When children become 12 they are assigned a job.  Instead of assigned, 12 year old Jonas is "selected". This means  he is givven the job of the Receiver. He receives memories of color, war,  animals, and love. Jonas is determined to share these things with the  community, but how? Jonas and the Giver, the only other person in the  community who can see color, hear music, and who gives Jonas the memories,  devise a plan which could save or destroy the community. The Giver is a  really great book, but I only recommend it for kids 11 years old and up,  because it\'s really upsetting at times. All in all, a terrific book.
