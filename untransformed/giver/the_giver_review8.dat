What if you lived in an society that had no pain, no hunger, no color, everything\'s the same, no unemployment, and no crimes.  Well twelve year old Jonas lived in such an community.  Jonas and all his other twelve year  old friends are scared, worried and carious about the Ceremony of twelve.  People receive their assignments for the community at this annual ceremony.  There were different jobs, such as the caretaker, and the assistant  director of recreation.  Jonas received the most important job out of all  of them. Jonas was chosen to be the community\'s Receiver of Memories.  He  was chosen for this job for a special reason that Jonas has experienced,  but still doesn\'t know what it is.  The Giver, an elderly man who was also  chosen to be the receiver of memories, now has the responsibility to teach  Jonas.  Jonas gradually learns just how costly this pain-free society can  be.This is really the best book ever, Lois Lowry used great descriptive  words to bring the book to life.  Once you pick this book up you will not  want to put it down.
