The ethically inspired theme of Lois Lowry\u2019s The Giver is told from the point of view of a young boy named Jonas.  Jonas lives in a futuristic culture where there are no feelings of pain, fear, anxiety, or grief.  The society\u2019s lack of variance and competition is due to the members of the community looking and behaving the same way.  The society has eliminated the ability to have choice, which results in the community members being assigned spouses and jobs at the age of twelve.  These assigned jobs are the occupations that the members will be part take in for their entire lives.  On Jonas\u2019 twelfth birthday, he is assigned Receiver of Memories which was previously held by The Giver. The role of Receiver of the Memories is to contain all of the memories of hurt and pleasure that the previous life used to have. The Giver gives all of the past memories to Jonas which causes Jonas to wonder what the members of his community are truly missing out on by having such a protected lifestyle.  By being so sheltered, the members of his community do not have the opportunity to relish and appreciate joy and happiness in life. The nonexistence of color, uniqueness, and personal choice cause Jonas pain, which results in his decision of change in the society. Lois Lowry\u2019s ability allow the reader to indulge themselves in Jonas\u2019 character is remarkable.  I believe the plot of the story is varied in preference; however, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  The Giver derives the question, \u201cIs being protected from life\u2019s negative aspects worth being deprived the joy that life presents?\u201d
