This is just a horrible book. My school is forcing me to read it. It is just so boreing. I don\'t even think my teacher can take it anymore beacause we have been reading it for 3 monthes and we only got up to chapter 10. You  see, we have to read it outloud in class. I dought we will ever finish this  horrible book. Spend your money on Harry Potter instead.
