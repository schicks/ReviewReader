I am a big fan of fantasy books and roleplaying games.  For years people have been telling me that I MUST read Lord of the Rings.  I have always had doubts, for two reasons.  First, I saw the old cartoon movies, which put me to sleep.  Second, I hate Halflings/Hobbits.  My reasoning is simple: I find the idea of short, chubby, jolly people that love to eat, sing, and sleep to be unheroic.  Yet somehow, this series wants to make them heroic.Well, the movie is coming out, and many people say this book is great, so I picked it up.So far, it is everything I feared it would be.I have read 130 pages filled with hobbit lameness, and the total cumulation of actual events could have easily been written in 20 pages, with a decent level of description and atmosphere.  There is at least one superfluos poem or song every 3 pages that usually begins with "O!", and has a minimum of 5 more exclamation points throughout.  I hate cheesy poetry about mundane acts, and I hate it when people overuse exclamation points.  I must also criticize Tolkein\'s use of misspellings as "flavor".  If he wants to make up new words, and explain them using footnotes at the bottom of the page, that is great. I feel it adds flavor, and shows that the world differs from our own.  Simply misspelling "wagon" doesn\'t cut it, and by his own admission, irritated the hell out of his edditors (Look! Flavor! O!). I desperately want to drench this book in oil, light it on fire, and throw it into oncoming traffic.  The problem is, I will then be criticised with "you haven\'t read the whole book, you are judging it on such a small portion of it".  Well, it is one thing to put a book down after the first chapter, or the first 10 pages.  I figure that within 130 pages, I know if I aminterested in where the book is going.  The idea of the hobbits wandering into the evil forest and being saved by some godlike being in their first "adventure" reminds me much of High School D&amp;D.  "Everything has to be amazing and spectacular, lets make them meet the eternal spirit of the earth on the first adventure!  Lets have them stumble into an unescapable doom, and not allow their own wiles to get them out!  Instead, let\'s introduce my new all powerful NPC to save their butts! O!"  The only difference is that my friend Mike and I would have made an NPC that was a badass of some sort (I\'m not saying that makes it better, it is just the only difference), instead of a fruitcake that sang songs about picking lillies off of the wallpaper.  Oh, and did I mention that he is short, jolly, and likes to eat? I am torn.  I don\'t know if I want to force myself through several more hours of suffering in order to give it another chance, or just toss the thing and assume that the movie will take that 130 pages and condense it into the 5 minutes it deserves.  I certainly will be happy not to see any "O!"s in the movie.
