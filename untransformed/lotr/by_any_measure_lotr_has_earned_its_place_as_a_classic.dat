Rather, this is a book that proves timeless in its themes, prose, and power.  Indeed, the universally recognized construct of good vs. evil has been the crown jewel of all stories since Genesis.  Humanity itself is reflected in this dynamic, and the drama unfolds in  Tolkien\'s pages with a grace and fury uncommon to the genre.  His tale of  the diminutive, peaceful Hobbits placed against a frightening array of evil  forces and corruption is one that reaches deep, clenching your heart.  It  is compelling because of its verisimilitude.  We all wish for our heroes to  be brave but to find valor in such an unexpected place is lyrically pure  beyond means.  Call it "Fairy Tale" or what you will-- LOTR is a  literary masterpiece, easily qualified by its keen portrayal of endurance  against adversity.But it has many other strengths.  Consider that the  civilizations, cultures, and history as devised by Tolkien are the product  of decades of careful research into Anglo-Saxon and Gaelic myth.  They seem  real because they are drawn from a felicitous past.  Painstaking effort  provided the invention of real languages and alphabets for his Elves and  Dwarfs.  His erudition inspires awe.  By great leaps of his imagination, he  gave Middle-Earth an authentic backdrop of mythical deities, battles,  natural wonders, and poetry.  "I\'ve always preferred history to  fiction," Tolkien is quoted as saying.  Indeed, he has provided such a  rich explication of this past that the narrative takes on a substance  unmatched in modern fantasy.This masterful portrait of high romance  and adventure stands apart.  The Lord of the Rings has been voted  "Book of the Century" by Britain\'s largest reader survey (not  once but TWICE). In the early 70\'s here in the United States it defined a  generation.  As C.S. Lewis once said of his friend\'s work: "Here are  beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron."
