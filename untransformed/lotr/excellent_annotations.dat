This newly published, annotated version of THE HOBBIT is excellent for fans of the book.  It may be TMI ("too much information") for the first-time reader.  The text of THE HOBBIT settles in the center of the book while Doug Anderson\'s notations appear in the outer margins.  At times it\'s a bit busy - but there\'s always fascinating reading! Tolkien fans are sure to get excited over this one.Doug Anderson includes lots of sources in his notes.  He quotes Tolkien\'s own letters, other fairy tales and legends that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as previous versions of the section he\'s noting.  The Gollum section ("Riddles in the Dark") is interesting.  Tolkien did some tinkering with the original Gollum story as its follow-up (LORD OF THE RINGS) was taking shape.  Seems that George Lucas is not the only person who\'s revised previously released work!  Tolkien was his predecessor.Also interesting are the many black and white illustrations that Anderson includes, many from foreign editions of THE HOBBIT.  Some of the art is hilarious, as it does not resemble Tolkien\'s characters at all!  There is a nice color section of illustrations in the center of the book.THE ANNOTATED HOBBIT is a handsome, interesting book to own if you\'re a fan of Bilbo and his adventures with the dwarves (or dwarfs?  That\'s covered in the book as well!)
