In 1970 I read "The Lord of the Rings" for the first time.  It was like nothing I\'d ever read, and it kind of spoiled fantasy for me ever since, because I started with the best and nothing else measures up (well, maybe Narnia).  I\'ve read it pretty much every year since, including once out loud to my children.  In 1978 my husband gave me the red-leather volume as a wedding present, and it\'s one of my prized possessions.  I have other copies to sling around, but I keep that one at home to read carefully and reverently.  I don\'t know if it\'s real leather or not, but it\'s certainly beautiful.  Ringers call it the "Red Book", after Bilbo\'s Red Book of Westmarch.  If I close my eyes I can call up the evocative smell of its pages, and see the beautful elven calligraphy in the margins.  My husband also gave me the companion volume of "The Hobbit" in green leather.  If you get this book, you should get that as well.
