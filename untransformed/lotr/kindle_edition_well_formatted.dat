I\'ll leave the review of Lord of the Rings to others and instead focus on the Kindle format. Ultimately it\'s very good. Anyone who is familiar with the books knows there are endnotes and the Kindle handles those well by making them linkable. The spacing and other formatting are top-notch and I haven\'t noticed any typos so overall an excellent purchase. My only minor complaint is that one could view the page numbers since some of the endnotes refer to them, even though the Kindle format doesn\'t have them (it\'s not a huge deal though since the location in the text and the note link to each other).
