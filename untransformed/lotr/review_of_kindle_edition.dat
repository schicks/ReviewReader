I\'ve been reading and re-reading Tolkien for 45 years and have numerous editions of the trilogy.  When I bought the Kindle it was the first book I bought.  Sorry, the Kindle version is very poor.  Ebooks often are in want of good proofreading but this has a staggering number of typos (proper nouns without capitalization, misspellings etc.)  The maps are also missing from this version.  For the price they could have done a much better job and honored Professor Tolkien\'s work.
