This is NOT a review of LOTR: It is, rather, specifically about the "Hardcover boxed, Millennium edition (October 1999)" from Houghton Mifflin. First off, LOTR is divided here into six volumes (plus a  volume of appendix material) -- not the three volumes one usually sees. The  titles of the three usual volumes have therefore changed; but it\'s not  stated where the new titles came from. Are they from Tolkien himself? From  his son? Or from some lesser source? (Yes, I know, the original LOTR has  Book I, Book II, etc.-- but not different titles for each of these).  Second, on the whole these "hardcovers" look a little cheesy to  me. The bindings certainly aren\'t leather: They look kinda like nothing  more than cardboard with a glossy lamination. The books\' spines  have no  "give," either: They, too, are of stiff, unbending cardboard. And  finally, it doesn\'t appear that the paper on which this "Millennium  Edition" is printed is acid-free (which lasts longer and doesn\'t  yellow with age). Like the covers, the paper also appears, to my eye, a  little cheap. (If a book\'s paper is acid-free, that fact is usually stated  on the copyright page.) So all in all the PHYSICAL aspects of this edition  (epecially at a list price of $70!) seem suspiciously second-rate. On the  positive side, this edition claims to be free of a large number of  typographical errors, misprints, and other textual mistakes that marred  earlier editions. Also a plus: The maps of Middle Earth here are clearer  and easier to read than those in earlier editions. Yet even this has a down  side, however: These nice maps appear ONLY in the 7th and final volume of  the boxed set, i.e., in the appendices! Why, oh, WHY weren\'t the maps run  in EACH of the six volumes of the story, so that a reader could easily  glance at a map as the tale progresses from volume to volume? Some of the  volumes in this edition have several *blank* pages at the end, and  therefore they could EASILY have accommodated the maps! Wasn\'t anybody  thinking of the READER when this edition was put together?
