Addendum January 2008:Let me say that while there may be finer editions (the 2000 HarperCollins black leather/india paper (now over $300US) and the 2004 UK 50th Anniversary HarperCollins edition (still in print, but over $150US where available), this US 50th Anniversary edition is easily the best edition in print in the US. Despite some complaints and comments by other reviewers to the contrary, this book is in fact leather bound. Many readers will have only had experience with a style of leather binding now rare (calfskin or morocco leather) that was quite heavy and very expensive. As an amateur bookbinder, typesetter, and papermaker who has studied with John Risseuw and others, I can say with absolute confidence that the binding on this edition is a type of elegant, thin leather formerly much used, known as "bonded leather", it is infact and deed: leather.Having set that issue to rest, let me also say that the other design and manufacturing consideration of the edition are first rate. I should say it would be a bargain of it were just cloth bound, and it should occupy a place of pride in anyone\'s library, and become a suitable heirloom. Have no fear if you are looking for the best in-print edition of LOTR. You will get it with this one.Two fine points. If you prefer an illustrated edition, perhaps the Centenary one-volume edition illustrated by Alan Lee is more suitable. No slipcase, a cloth binding, and the text, unlike this edition, does not reflect the most recent corrections (this and the lower priced 50th Anniversary "Standard" edition are the only editions in the US which do). Also, this edition is sometimes confused with an earlier commemorative published around 2000-2001 from Houghton Mifflin that was famously defective in its production, with missing or torn pages, improperly sewn or bound pages and signatures, and all around sloppy construction. They sound and look similar, but always check the ISBN and be sure that you are looking at the correct edition (which should have a preface by Wayne G. Hammond regarding the text corrections). This edition, whatever other opinions may be, has had no such manufacturing problems, and is for the moment the definitive text of LOTR.July 2007:Beware that many of the reviews posted here for this edition do appear to actually refer to another, slightly earlier edition that was defective. While I can\'t provide ISBN numbers, there was another commemorative edition published shortly before this one (and which was also slipcased in a black leather binding with gilt edges) that of a limited edition of 1500 copies, 1100 were recalled by the publisher due to defects in the binding and assembly, specifically the problems listed here of bad cutting and gluing etc. This edition here is that which was brought out to replace it. It contains the Mazarbul paintings and different cover art from the earlier one, and can be distinguished from it on this basis at least. I bought my copy from Amazon last year and it is perfect. I have examined at least 3 other new copies at bookstores and each of those was also as it should be. I have also seen a used copy of the earlier defective and it is clearly not the same edition, though I imagine it will become valuable due to scarcity in time (only 400 copies extant, at the most)Having said this, and while I recommend this edition without reservation, it is not the most lavish or expensive edition ever printed. It does contain the definitive corrected text according to Christopher Tolkien and the Tolkien Estate, though the Folio Society ($175) and Easton Press ($295)  both publish editions which are much more expensive, and there are and have been numerous other leather (quarter to full-bound) and full-bound cloth, slipcased (paper, cloth, leather), gilt-edged, illustrated or engraved (various), hubbed, deckled, and otherwise "deluxe" multi- and single-volume editions of LOTR over the years.Still, with the possible exception of the British HarperCollins 50th anniversary edition (which is a complete seperate book design [and unique ISBN]: covers, case, color scheme, exterior markings, type, etc.) I do think this is an elegant, beautiful book. The color, the choice of foil stamped images (and the stamping quality itself), the inclusion of Tolkien\'s own artwork (and the particular choices there), the paper, type, ink, and other elements each and all combine to produce an outstanding book-object. I believe Tolkien would be most pleased with it, on its own merit and compared to all the other editions currently in print.
