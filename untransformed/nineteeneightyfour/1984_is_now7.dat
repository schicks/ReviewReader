Although I read this book years ago, I decided I needed a refresher since much is being said about it in the news today.  My husband and I drove from CA to CO this summer, and we took this little book along.  WOW!  We kept repeating, "That\'s happening NOW!  That\'s happening right NOW!"  And with all the current NSA stuff in the news, all readers can\'t help but see the connections.  The scary thing is that Orwell wrote this book in 1949.  How did he know?  What link did he have to our current situation?  That\'s the freaky part.  Anyway, listening to the book made our drive a pleasure.  We also listened to Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand and would recommend this as a companion to 1984.  But be prepared:  Atlas Shrugged is 50 disks long!  Still... riveting!  :)
