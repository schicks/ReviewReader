Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is "timeless," (Orwell constructs a better sentence than most  "literary artists"),  the book\'s themes get more and more frightening as  Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was  in the days when 1984 was literally "the future," (even though Orwell had  always intended it as a satire on contemporary Britain, with "1948" the  originally intended title); in England today the resonances are especially  profound, and what looked "old-fashioned" to `sixties and `seventies sci-fi  readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We\'re beginning to catch up  with the US when it comes to presidential-style "leadership" and "spin,"  whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the  politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and  the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the  guilty denial of the achievements of the British Empire, (whilst the Roman  and Greek civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst  shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the  manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and  Newspeak, respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you  can\'t say become thoughts you can\'t think, and an attempted conversation  with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it  has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale  thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received  simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a  law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the  reflection that we are so far from Shakespeare one could weep; then I read  1984 again, where Orwell has Winston wake up one morning with the name on  his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly  written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It\'s also  fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again,  and read it to your children!
