ISBN: 978-0-451-52493-5Let me start by saying that 1984 is my favorite book of all time. I want to be buried with this book...but this version leaves something to be desired. I recently purchased the Signet Classic paperback version, which is one of those taller (7 1/2" X 4 1/4") paperbacks that started appearing in recent years. I started reading it and noticed there was something subtly different about it. It turns out that my version has been altered. Words that originally had an English (British) spelling in the original, have now been Americanized. Just on the first page, coloured has been changed to colored; moustache to mustache and metre to meter. Now, to some people this may seem like a small thing. To me though, this is aggravating...possibly disturbing. Did the American publishers think that Americans aren\'t smart enough to read it with the English spelling of some words? The odd thing is that while they altered the British spelling, they left in words that are typically British like: flat (apartment) and lift (elevator)...and again these are just on the first page.To me this is akin to a British film that gets distributed in the US, then the US film distributor decides that they need to overdub a British actor\'s voice with an American\'s because they\'re worried your average Americans wouldn\'t understand the film.I have found out that there is a Penguin version offered that is the original un-dumbed down version.
