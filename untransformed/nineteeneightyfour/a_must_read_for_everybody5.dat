This novel is a must read for every high school senior in America and should be a highly recommended "must read" for all college graduates.  How the author Orwell could predict in 1948 what our governments are doing worldwide is so uncanny its frightening.  I only wish "we the people" would take notice and attempt to begin changing our government back the way our Constitution says BY LAW what we are suppose to do.  Sadly, this is not the case. If there\'s any true democracy remaining a hundred years from now people/citizens will look back at this novel and say:  "They were warned and still did not pay attention."
