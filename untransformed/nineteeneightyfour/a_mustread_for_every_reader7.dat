I first read this book in high school but never really appreciated it till just recently. With the passage of the Homeland Security Bill, I thought I\'d better refresh my memory of this book. And this book is scarier than any Stephen King book ~~ it\'s scary because our future has arrived. With Big Brother watching our every move ...The book is a reflection upon past times as well as the future ~~ it\'s a history of mankind. It is about power. It is about control ~~ one man over another. It is about power through total submission ~~ submersion of the self. It is not about the greater good of life or mankind. It is man at its very worst. Orwell took a deep look into despair and wrote bluntly about it. The surface of it is Big Brother watching every move you make ~~ till you get into the book and realize there is much more at sake. And it\'s so well-written. No matter that I wanted to put the book down and ignore it, I couldn\'t. I had to read it to the last page. And it\'s the scariest book I have ever read.1-9-03
