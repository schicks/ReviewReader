I first heard of this book when, at the age of 17, my best friend, a year older, told me about it.  One year later, I read it as a college freshman.  I have brushed up on it several times over the decades -- five decades to be exact.  At first, to me it was simply a science-fiction novel.  But as the years have rolled by, it seems to me that Orwell\'s nightmare has come true.  This is true with regard to the endless wars, the shifting identity of the latest bogeyman, the lies that are our daily provender from all directions, the demonization of the individual, the internal spying, the hesitation to defy conventional thinking, the shifting definition of words, the dumbing down, state control of the media, the two-minute hate (called by another name, of course), all the jugglery with "truth" and so forth, it is all here and now.  I hesitate to give concrete examples for fear that some of you will think that all of this is to be identified with certain factions, when in fact there is only ONE faction in our society, operating in unison like the tentacles of the octopus.  It is not simply political correctness, it is everything.  This is not something that can be voted out in an election.  You will say that our students are taught this book as required reading, they have all been warned, we are on our guard, we cannot be deceived.  You are deceived every day of your lives, you are surrounded by deception.  You deceive yourselves in your very thinking.  You think in Newspeak and do not know that this is what you are doing.  I have seen this coming and it is before us and in us.  You -- yes, even you -- love Big Brother.
