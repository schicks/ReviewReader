**Minor SPOILER"There is no doubt that George Orwell was ahead of his time when he wrote this book.  If you look at our society today, although no where as severe as Orwell\'s vision,  the shear human stupidity that abounds and the oppressive governments still present in certain parts of the world leads one to believe that his vision if we are not careful could become a reality in the near future.  It seems that as time goes by and with all the technological advancement we\'ve made, individuality and uniqueness  are  in danger of becoming extinct.  It\'s enough to listen to  today\'s music, to see what we now call "entertainment"  for the masses  to know that George Orwell ( at least when it comes to human beings) was right on the money.It  certainly wasn\'t a pleasure read and while I do admit that  it is a relevant book and it is one of the most thought provoking books I\'ve ever read, I can\'t say that it is one of the best books I\'ve read in my life.  It was deeply disturbing and depressing and I was thoroughly disappointed with the end.  I consider myself a realist but I was really hoping that Winston\'s idea of the defeat of Big Brother  would become a reality, but in the end the Party is the one that wins.  Did Orwell write this book with the intention of scaring us? No, he wrote it as a warning of how seriously screwed up the world can become if we stop thinking  for ourselves. I only recommend this book if you like  dystopian (opposite of utopia) society books.
