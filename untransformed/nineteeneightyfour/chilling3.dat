What a mind-bender! I read this in high school in the 60\'s but at that time it was very futuristic and I didn\'t come away with much. Now, with the way the world is I thought it would be fun to re-read it. Obviously, it didn\'t happen in 1984 but slowly we are creeping into the unknown Big Brother. With cameras everywhere now and the NSA, it is not preposterous to think it could happen not in our lifetimes, but in a future far from now. It explains how the past is rewritten (as history is constantly being done now)to the point where there was no past. Children born think this is the way the world (Oceana) always was. To think that George Orwell wrote this in 1948 shows the forethought he had to write such a book. I wish this book was still on the high school reading lists! There is a big message that there should be no one "rich" and everyone should be the same,(socialism which is being pushed now) BUT the proles are poor and have very little. Parts of it take some concentration (when it comes to Winston reading "the book")but well worth it.Just look at North Korea. People don\'t even have privacy in their own homes, they are sent to labor camps if they don\'t clap when told to, they are killed at will, etc.
