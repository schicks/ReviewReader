So much has been written by others on this classic text that I will limit my comments to that aspect of the book I feel is still the most important - the manipulation of language to control behavior. Orwell understood how  crucial meaning and communication is to social and political behavior. The  Bolsheviks first and then the Nazis both went to great lengths to  manipulate meaning, creating an acceptable vocabulary of politically  positive words and images and an equally negative vocabulary for that which  was to be vilified and destroyed. Attempting to channel behavior into  patterns predefined by these limited modes of expression represents the  greatest part of the state propogandist\'s art. Orwell reduced the  complexity of this enterprise to something that could be seen for the con  game it is. His invention of \'newspeak\' demonstrates the reducto ad  absurdum of such verbal restrictiveness.In our day, whether Big Brother  is really watching or not, we suffer from some of the same contraints of  limited language and, in term, limited behavioral options. On the one hand  we suffer from a language of polictical correctness that strives to offend  no one, but makes speech clumsy and artificial. On the other extreme we  suffer from the limited categories that the professional news media use -  the narrow meanings available to them for understanding and communicating  what is considered \'news\'. Since politicians contribute to this limited  vocabulary and play off of it, it saves them from facing much real in depth  analysis and critique and limits the public to shallow expositions that  distort reality and make meaningful political choice impossible.So 1984  has come and gone and we haven\'t fallen into the dramatic pit that Orwell  pictured, but the language we use to deal with social and political issues  has been so attenuated that we are in danger of becoming slaves to a  limited set of possibilities because we cannot even articulate any  alternatives.
