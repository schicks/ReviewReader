I first read this book in spring of 1967 as a college sophomore.  I thought it was interesting and easy to read.  I thought it was a tale about a nation where government had gone to the extreme - a socialist bureaucracy.  I never suspected that government could get this intrusive in a democratic-republic, the most freedom loving nation in the world!However, I now wonder if we weren\'t on our way to bloated, over-powering government.  And I wonder if socialism and bureaucracy haven\'t completely taken hold, entrenched large powerful government, unconcerned with individual rights???  Orwell\u2026 a genius or a prophet?  Everyone should read this book accompanied by a copy of the Bill of Rights!
