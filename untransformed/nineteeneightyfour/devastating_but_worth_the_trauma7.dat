For as long as I live I will always remember the day I finished "1984," the first time I read it, while seated in the back of my high school trigonometry class.  Inconsolable, I gazed over the last five words - completely devastated - and sobbed uncontrollably.In the ten or more times I have reread it since, I was no less shocked and shattered by the book\'s conclusion.  Ostensibly a cautionary tale about a midlevel bureaucrat assigned to help reduce the number of words in the dictionary, "1984" is the tragic story of Winston Smith, a freethinking, middle aged man, who through glimmers of a childhood memories and clandestine visits to "prole" neighborhoods (newspeak for poor), radically tries to reconcile life in a totalitarian nanny state.With the omnipresent hum of the tele-screen always present, Winston is the perfect party patsy, saluting the authorities and seething with anger at the daily "two minutes hate" that secretly leave our hero wondering who is the Emmanuel M. Goldstein, the object of the government\'s loathing.When despite medical problems too gruesome to recount and enough secret spies to fill a Le Carre novel, Winston Smith conjures up enough optimism to pursue a romantic relationship with Julia, "1984" takes on a frightening turn.  A devoted (or maybe not)? member of the Junior Anti-Sex League, whose signature emblem is the form-fitting sash that hugs seductively around her waistline, Julia is perhaps not the refuge Winston seeks.  Or is she?Without destroying the truly devastating ending, I would wholeheartedly recommend 1984 to anyone who is interested in politics, language, romance and government.Yes, you may be left devastated by the book\'s last five words, but you will certainly be left with more to think about than drying your tears.  - Regina McMenamin
