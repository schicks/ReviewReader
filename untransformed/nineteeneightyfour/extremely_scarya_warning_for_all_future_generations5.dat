When reading this book, one is dragged through the emotions of love, hate, betrayal, despair, and utter, unabashed rage.  This novel tells a story of negative utopia in which the government knows all and sees all.  The citizens are worthless except as workers.  Winston and Julia go through a secret love affair despite better judgement.  The use of allegory for socialism is impressive.  Many parallels, obvious and subtle, can be drawn between the two.  The story is enthralling and the book is hard to put down.The reader may feel safe from the situation in this book, but it is not impossible.  Of course, 1984 has come and gone, but we must realize that such situations are possible.  That is why this book deserves 5 stars.  1984 uses exaggeration to prove a point.  Freedom and capitalism are definately worth the drawbacks.  We see that if we give the government our freedom, we will eventually become slaves to the government.Orwell was brilliant in this work.  We are forewarned.  Everyone should read this book (at least once) and try to take a lesson from it.
