Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it\'s an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the "Kindle edition" of this great novel.  Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences.  It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality.
