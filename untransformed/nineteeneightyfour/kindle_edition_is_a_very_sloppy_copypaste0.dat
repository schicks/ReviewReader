The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I\'m surprised weren\'t noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn\'t bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file.
