This marks the third time I\'ve read this book (previously in 1989 at the age of 14, and again in 2007).One of the most important novels ever written, but also one of the most depressing (though the tone and manner in which the Appendix is written does offer the reader a wee-bitty glimmer of hope). More frighteningly relevant than ever: on the one hand, sure, thankfully, 31 years after "1984" was supposed to have taken place (and 67 years after it was actually written), democracy and capitalism still exist, and the Iron Curtain has collapsed; on the other hand, seeing how even in the free-market democracies, Big Government has gotten more and more intrusive into private citizens\' lives (see the NSA surveillance scandal in the US, the presence of CCTV cameras on practically every street corner in London, the ability of spy satellites in geosynchronous orbit thousands of miles above the Earth to take close up shots of people and property alike), not to mention any idiot with a camera phone to record your activities and emulate the Junior Spies of Orwell\'s book, and it becomes readily apparent that the technological potential for a Big Brother-type omnipresent superstate is stronger than ever. The year 1984 may have come and gone, but lovers of civil liberty need to be more vigilant than ever in this day and age, and reading Orwell\'s book helps to drive that point home.
