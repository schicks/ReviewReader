Many of us use Orwell\'s book for our own purposes, to forward our own ideas and political positions. Even though Orwell was speaking quite specifically about a particular socialist experiment, communism, and a particularly horrible totalitarian gulag-state - Stalin\'s Soviet Union - his book has such a universal scope that it can be squeezed and pushed and pulled about until it can be made to fit almost any political system anywhere. In this way great works are often de-constructed to make them useful to whomever wants to make a point.A lot of us here are likening the world of Orwell\'s "1984" to current life in the U.S. While there are definitely elements of this overreaching intrusion into our private lives today in the United States, be aware of how much farther down that road so many other countries have already gone (and down which we are very unlikely to go). Start with the Islamic nations where the Mullahs exort the masses to their Two Minutes Of Hate towards us every Friday in the mosques. In Britain, under a Labour Government, right now, there are not only surveillance cameras - called CCTV cameras - on virtually every corner in the cities, they are now beginning to install microphones as well ([...]) starting in the council flats. They directly say it is to monitor "anti-social" behavior. This is the insidious beginnings of "1984." Well past what we are enduring and in the very country from which Orwell sprang and from which our own ideas of civil liberties originated.In all the world\'s dictatorships, from Cuba to North Korea to virtually all the Arab states, there is one version or another of the Thought Police. They may be religious police as they are in Iran and Saudi Arabia. They may be undercover military police as they are in North Korea. They may just be your neighbors, as they were in Mao\'s China (and for all we know, still are to some extent, at least). But in all these places the horror of Orwell\'s vision is much more advanced than in the U.S. People actually are killed. In Iraq there are still 275,000 "disappeards," people who simply ceased to exist under the brutal totalitarian regime of Saddam Hussein, himself a great admirer of Stalin. (I didn\'t make that number up, btw, Amnesty International did) If you want more proof, just ask a Palestinian homosexual about what constitutes "anti-social behavior" in the Territories. Actually, if you want to ask a Palestinian homosexual that question you will have to go to Tel Aviv because that is where they all live. Palestinian gays are either dead, in prison, or in Israel.We might be well advised to also be aware that in many other places in the world the true reality of 1984\'s dystopic vision has been in place for decades, and citizens continue to suffer real torture, imprisonment, and death for things which Americans take for granted as being protected under our Constitution. Yes, there are some egregious violations that are going on here under the guise of the Patriot Act, but they are constantly under fire from our own legal system and from private NGOs and civil liberties watchdogs. Imagine having these kinds of groups in, say, Burma: It\'s instant imprisonment - just ask Aung San Suu Kyi. What is going on here is nothing when compared to the terrors vistited daily upon millions of people around the world who would only love the chance to come to this country. I don\'t suspect any of them would think they had strayed into Room 101. ekw
