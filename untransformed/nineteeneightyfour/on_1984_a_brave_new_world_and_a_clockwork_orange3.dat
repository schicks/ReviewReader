The 20th Century has brought forth dystopia, and a plethora of dystopia literature.  Some of the books, such as The Giver, are very good.  Others, like Fahrenheit 451, are excellent.  Of them, two are genius - A Brave New World (Huxley) - A Clockwork Orange (Burgess) - and one is supreme: 1984 (Orwell).1984 is comprehensive.  Not in explaining the machinery and origin of the nightmare state, but in the experience of the individual within.  Huxley is much more scientifically aware than Orwell, and his replacement of the party structure with a caste structure is profound and dark.  Burgess, better than both these, understands the dependence of creativity upon destruction and destruction upon creativity, within the individual and the state.  Neither Orwell nor Huxley offers their hero the alternative of `coming alive\' through violence, which Alex so beautifully illustrates.Also, I believe Burgess, of the three, to be the best storyteller.  His prose is high art; musical, rhythmic, and perfect in its strangeness and familiarity.  Huxley\'s book is somewhat like a puzzle with 8 big pieces, which fit exactly and predictably.  His strength is not the flow of his story, but the brilliance of his images.  Orwell is much too engrossed in his political message to be purely an artist.  He is, of course, an artist, but firstly he is a political theorist.Still, it may seem unfair to compare these three; they are written for different purposes and theorize from different experience.  This is indubitably true.  But it is also true for us to want to organize, sort, and place books into a logical whole.  And placement, for most of us, is related to importance.These three books are of the 20 most beautiful written in English in the last century - it is only my opinion that 1984 is the best.  The knowledge and medium of 1984 is diverse.  In part it is a theory on the meaning of history - it offers definitions of impersonal experience - it is an account of the individual, his will, passion, and perspective - it is about love and sex and their relation to the state - it is an attack upon intellectuals - it is about the nature of fear and courage - but, first of all, it is literature, written as a story...because it belongs to the individual, the private reader, not to academics or institutions.
