I read this book long before the year 1984.  It was horrible, but an accurate picture of the future.  Unfortunately, we are living "1984" now.  It came true far faster and it is more sinister because most Americans don\'t realize this kind of government with its fingers and ears and successful propaganda is already here; we are already living the life of "1984."Every American should read this book, and be in awe of George Orwell for having predicted the life of having our every ounce of privacy encroached by the government.  The USA is worse than Canada, but Canada is never far behind.
