1984 is a cautionary tale for America! In light of our "information" society\'s 24/7 connection to the Internet, the perpetual  "wars" against nearly invisible enemies, and the rising dominance of one political party, this book appears quite prophetic. It is not far-fetched to realize that -- with our growing dependence on technology -- the masses could one day be completely controlled by a small group of individuals bent on maintaining their power at ALL COSTS. A worthy and noble contribution to enlightened minds.
