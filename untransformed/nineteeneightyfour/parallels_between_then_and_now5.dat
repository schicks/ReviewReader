There have been times when I have read this book and could have sworn it was written by someone who time traveled forward and went back and wrote what he didn\'t understand. Most notably were the ear shells in his wife\'s ears as well as the TV wall. Looking at the sizes of televisions these as compared to when the book was written is especially interesting.I understand his desire to just get away and not be watched all the time, and write about a time that he could hardly remember. It was written so long ago yet I can see so many similarities between it and our creeping police state. Every other year or so, I re-read it and Eli Weisel\'s  Night. One man\'s experience in a different world. My Weiseal\'s was non fiction and he lived it but I have no doubt that one day soon we will remember that &amp; 1984 and go searching for them, only to find that they are down the memory hole
