Like most everybody my age (54), this book was either required our desired reading in junior high or high school and I was among those readers.  This time I wanted to see the movie but a review of the movie said to be sure to read the book first.  However, it had been so long since I read 1984 that I decided to read it again.  First of all, I was really glad that I purchased the audio as well as the e-book, the narration was so well done and vivid and made it possible to read in the car when I wanted to get to the ending quicker.  But as far as the story, this book is still a good read and maybe even better as an adult than when I was a kid.  I found myself comparing it to even modern day politics and realizing that Orwelle\'s wasn\'t just a hypothetical / prophetic peek into the future of his time, but a peek in to the future of any power hungry totalitarian form of government.  It\'s still a cautionary tale and now I can\'t wait to see the movie to see how well they did.One little caveat that I\'ve been thinking about since I first posted this review.  I heard awhile back that people couldn\'t get 1984 as an e-book and then that there were complaints that section(s) were missing.  I don\'t know if that\'s true but it sure could be and how 1984 of them if it is.  So as much as I like the e-books because they save the clutter and keep all of my books handy all the time - I started wondering if someday the books that we love so much will be gone (or even worse, altered) and maybe we really should keep a hard copy handy.  I haven\'t replaced this one in hard copy, but just a thought - especially if you see how possible 1984 is becoming even in our lifetime...remember the telescreens watching them?  Well, just saying.  :)
