For a novel written so long ago (1949), it is amazing how Orwell predicted the future behavior of governments towards their citizens.  Anyone who believes that big government can be paternalistic and caring for its citizenry without destroying their freedom and happiness in the process, should read this novel.  Hopefully, it is still required reading wherever schools still seek to educate their students instead of just indoctrinating them.
