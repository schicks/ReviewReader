+++++This novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is about the effects of totalitarianism.  Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party ("The Party") whose leader (actually dictator) is "Big Brother."  The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of "Oceania" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party\'s political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of "Newspeak" which utilizes what is called "doublethink."Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken).  It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought.  For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and "ungood."  Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in one\'s mind and believe in them both.  The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink.  Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink.  But they also have other methods.  For example, they have the "Thought Police" that investigate "thoughtcrimes."  These are "crimes" of just having negative thoughts about The Party.  Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls.  Thus, "Big Brother is watching you" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O\'Brien (who is the personification of The Party).  O\'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did).  He makes them pay for their "crimes."This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it\'s impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell.  Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand.  Why does he state this?  He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984.  (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)This novel is in a word fascinating!  It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination.  It begins slow but gradually picks up speed.  And the story is very interesting.Finally, after reading this book, I recommend watching the 1984 movie "1984" starring John Hurt and Richard Burton (his last movie role).In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all.  Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949;  3 parts or 24 chapters;  325 pages)+++++
