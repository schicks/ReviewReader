Not for the faint of heart, this book grips you and won\'t let go. Although written in the 40s (?), Orwell\'s message of the horrors of what might happen under a socialist government has not staled through the years. I had always heard the phrase "Big Brother is watching you", but never understood all that those simple words entailed until I cracked this one open for a read. What I found was an experience very hard to forget. The description of Winston\'s world is surprisingly vivid, and one can almost feel the "telescreens" silently watching your every move. The torture scenes and mind games the O\'Brien brings along about a third of the way in are nothing if not chilling. And then there\'s the abrupt and haunting ending... I\'m not ashamed to say that when I finished I hurled this book across the room in anger, much to the surprise of my family. A classic that I hope will stay on reading lists for years to come, this book should be required reading for all those who considered themselves "educated". Pick it up. You won\'t regret it.
