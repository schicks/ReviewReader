I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were "forced" to read this in High School for I would have surely  written good papers on it. I can\'t see how anyone can dislike this classic.  Jane Austen\'s character "Emma" has her faults of course, be she  is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those  characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no  doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen  work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based  on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before  Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it  all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely  recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I\'ll make my  kids read it some day. It is superb!
