Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I\'ll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife," we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I\'ve read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what\'s going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There\'s also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be.  Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart.
