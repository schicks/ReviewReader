Jane Austen\'s "Emma" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make "Emma" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen\'s books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma\'s character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one\'s library. I would suggest "Emma" above any other Jane Austen\'s classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all.
