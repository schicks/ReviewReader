For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why\'d I bother? Because I\'m a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they\'d normally pooh-pooh. Because that\'s when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.
