A mother\'s driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn\'t like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn\'t marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter\'s suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married.  Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it\'s Jane Austin\'s timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn\'t read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60\'s and the "Women\'s Movement," sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin\'s works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don\'t tell us. Austin doesn\'t give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don\'t know much about what they eat other than "venison" or "meat." While people often "color" when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin\'s day didn\'t work. The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife\'s and others\' foibles but never sees his own.
