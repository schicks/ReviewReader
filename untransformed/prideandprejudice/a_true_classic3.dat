I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching. Emma is so busy arranging other people\'s lives that she neglects her own wants and needs. Emma is wealthy and a godd person, but she\'s not a saint and she doean\'t come off as one.
