I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me.  I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed.  It had everything a great story should have.  This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read.  It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work.  This book taught me a lot about myself.  Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be.  When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet.  She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel.  She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end.  It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago.  I feel now like the times have truly not change much.  Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends.  This novel was a true untimely classic.  Although this story is about love, it is not all good times.  It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers.  There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way.  This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry.  I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began.  At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out.  It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned.  The literary value of this work in unbelievable.  As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it.  My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people.  Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work!  She truly moved me!  This literary work was enchanting.  As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up.  Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least.  It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend.  This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title.  The long journey to love, is far, and difficult, but in the end true love prevails.
