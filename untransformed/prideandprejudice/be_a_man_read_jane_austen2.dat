I\'m a recent newlywed who decided to raid his wifes bookshelf and this was the first book of hers that I picked up. Wanting to be better read and enjoying the movie "Sense and Sensibility." I recommend to anyone that is curious but apprehensive of Austen like I was to see a film based on one of her books. You will hear the use and cadence of victorian speech which will, in my humble opinion, make her books more accessible and easier to read. This is the first Jane Austen I\'ve read and I am now bonafide fan.This is one of those stories where the destination is not important but the journey is. Within the first ten pages, the stage is set. The two headstrong protagonists, Miss Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy cannot stand one another at the beginning of the book. Sparks fly and meet with typical results. The characters are distinct and memorable. Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth\'s father, was one of my favorites. Anyone who is an admirer of dry "british" humor will find themselves in stitches. It is the first book in a very long time where I found myself laughing out loud and on more than one occasion.A moderately quick read for those used to victorian prose. I for one am glad that I got over the "girly" stigma that\'s usually associated with Jane Austen. It has made me consider other books in my wifes arsenal I normally would not have otherwise.I will, however, pass on her "The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"Great book. Enjoy.
