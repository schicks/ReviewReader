I never thought I\'d have a favorite book or author until I read Pride and Prejudice.  It is, by far, the most beautifully written love story in literature, in my opinion.Miss Eliza Bennet is the second eldest daughter of an English gentleman whose estate can only go to a male successor upon his death.  Because he and Mrs. Bennet are unable to conceive a male child, it is the best course for the girls to marry and marry well.  The great advantage the girls have is that they are beautiful, with the eldest girl, Jane, being the most beautiful of them all.The Bennets live in Longbourn, a small village just outside of Meryton, a quaint little town.  The story begins when Mr. Bingley, a very amiable and wealthy young bachelor, decides to lease an estate in the area.  At a ball, Mr. Bingley introduces his best friend, Mr. Darcy, another wealthy bachelor, and his sisters to the local society.  It is here where Mr. Bingley meets the Bennet girls and starts to fall in love with Jane Bennet, and it is also here where Mr. Darcy meets Elizabeth.  Elizabeth immediately dislikes Darcy for several reasons but mainly because he insults her by first refusing to dance with her and then by saying, with Elizabeth within hearing distance, that he isn\'t in the habit of asking girls, who have been rejected by other men, to dance.Elizabeth is a complex character, a young woman who is wise beyond her years, reserve, has a dry sense of humor, friendly but very cynical of her world and of love.  In contrast, Jane is sensitive, likes to think well of people, very friendly, and somewhat fragile.  Bingley\'s personality is a perfect complement to Jane\'s.  He\'s friendly, generous, somewhat na\xefve and looks up to Darcy.  Darcy is brooding, quiet, reserved, prideful, and yet loyal and protective of his friends and family.The story progresses to where Darcy discovers his growing attraction to Elizabeth, despite his best efforts, and proposes to her.  Because of his social status and wealth, Darcy expects Elizabeth to say "yes" to his marriage proposal.  To his surprise, she not only turns him down, she also tears right into him:  His haughty behavior, rudeness, and his part in driving Bingley and Jane apart.  Yes, Darcy had been up to no good in breaking up Bingley and Jane.  This sets the stage for heartbreak, courtship, scandal, intrigue, and reconciliation and finally a happy ending for both couples.Jane Austen paints her characters and their dialogue with such splendidly crafted sentences, such as "I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"  She takes time to enrich the story with picturesque descriptions of each setting, and describes each character in such a way that you easily understand the layer of complexity in each.  For example, Elizabeth dislikes those who she thinks are vain, but yet she prides herself in her ability to read people\'s personalities and they\'re like.  Wickham, the protagonist in this story, is, on the surface, well-mannered, kind, and has a "good face," but is really a liar, thief and a gambler.I highly recommend this book.  I\'ve read it numerous times and there\'s always something new to discover with each reading.
