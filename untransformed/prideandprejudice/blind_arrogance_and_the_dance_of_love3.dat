Like all of her novels, Jane Austen\'s EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals.  But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure.  Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, "flawed."The nature of Emma\'s flaw is essentially Austen\'s observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct.  And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking.  The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap.  The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read.  Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest.  In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer
