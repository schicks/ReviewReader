I read the adapted version of this novel for children as a kid and I loved it. However, reading the original novel was difficult since I was used to the simple words for the children\'s one. I even avoided reading it for quite a while until I picked it up again a few days ago. Now I can\'t seem to put it down. I\'m also planning to read Jane Austen\'s other novels as well.
