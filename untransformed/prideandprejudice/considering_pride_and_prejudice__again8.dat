I downloaded the illustrated Kindle version of Pride and Prejudice for free from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon!  This is one of my favorite books and one that I have re-read several times and will read again.  OK.  So you know this isn\'t a bitch and complain session and that I am appreciative of the freebies I have gotten from Amazon.  So here it goes, the good, bad, and the suggestions.  This illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice - offered by Amazon - is beautifully formatted for the Kindle.  It is attractive and appealing and like most Kindle books is a pleasure to e-read.The only problem that I can see  - or actually CAN\'T see - is the muted e-ink illustrations or the text below each illustration.  Even when I zoom in on the illustration, though I can see the illustration better, I still can\'t read the writing :(  I have a Kindle DX (larger Kindle), so this must be a serious problem for people with regular 7 in. sized Kindles.  If the e-ink problem with the nine illustrations were solved, I would gladly pay .99 cents for a copy of this partially illustrated book.  If the problem were fixed AND each of the sixty-one chapters were presented with one of the Brock illustrations, I would gladly pay $9.99 for the e-book.  And please don\'t tell me to buy the newer, smaller Kindle because the e-ink is sharper.  I have tested it out at the store, and though somewhat sharper, it is not sharp enough to make up for 60 year old eyes when e-ink is muted.Any way, I will make due with this freebie from Amazon and keep searching the web site from time to time for the improved edition:)
