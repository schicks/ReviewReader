If you don\'t fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen\'s best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth\'s words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen.  There are many occasions where Elizabeth\'s character shines through.  She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself.  It is as if Jane said, "Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like."Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen\'s ideal man.  He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there.  And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy.  Isn\'t it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth\'s relationship with Mr. Bennet.  Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they?  Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant.  He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm.  Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy.  This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth.  We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine.  Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction.
