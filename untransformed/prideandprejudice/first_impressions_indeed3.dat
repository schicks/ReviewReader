Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most  wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it  was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth  Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she  possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in  general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and  judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as  "polite" society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her  gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed  gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored.  He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the  "polite society" Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his  disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn,  as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the  relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a  personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her  book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the  complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and  Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one  hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much  more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and  Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression,  as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts  and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title  characteristics.
