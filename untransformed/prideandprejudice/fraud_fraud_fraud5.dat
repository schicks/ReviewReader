NOT by Penguin Classics! A CreateSpace Ripoff!Despite the clever attempt to deceive the buyer, this is NOT the Penguin Classics edition of Pride and Prejudice, but a worthless production from CreateSpace.Comically large (8.5"X11") with no spaces between paragraphs and miniscule fonts, this book is unreadable.I\'m so sick of these ripoffs. Notice that the cover is identical to the Penguin Classics edition, but without the Penguin logo. As this piece of trash is the #3 result for an Amazon search for "Pride and Prejudice", I\'m guessing the thieves selling this book are doing fairly well for themselves. Do yourselves a favor and look down to the #8 result (or below) for a readable copy by a real publisher.
