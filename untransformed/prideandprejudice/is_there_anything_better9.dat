In college, Iw as supposed to read this book.  But I never did because I just assumed it would be boring.  Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it\'s snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on.  That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: "Guns and Ammo" and "Field and Stream".  Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea.  I brought the book with me to read, but didn\'t really think I would get all that much reading of it done.  True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn\'t sure if I could really concentrate on her.  Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made.  4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got.  (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.)  Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it\'s fun, it\'s hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it\'s not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the "refined" yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England.  This is by far my favorite Austen novel of the bunch (with Emma coming in a close second).  So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can\'t have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away.  And no.. this book is not solely the domain of high school etachers and academians.. you\'ll be surprised how much you may enjoy it.
