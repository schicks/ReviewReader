"~Though only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read.  I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty.  One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Jane Austen\'s Pride and Prejudice at my mother\'s recommendation.  I do not  ordinarily like my mother\'s taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be  very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her  suggestion."~ table, class and late into the night, I read my beloved  Pride and Prejudice.  I love everything about it.  I love the characters;  especially Elizabeth Bennet!  I love the Victorian vernacular which works  so well for this particular novel.  I love the scintillating plot and the  suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together  but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are (temporarily) keeping  them apart."~ contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to  it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable.  I cannot imagine Elizabeth  or Darcy or Bingley or Jane speaking any less eloquently; it would  completly ruin the novel!  The flowery language completes the whole effect  of reading a Jane Austen novel."~ to read.  I can offer no suggestions  to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in every essence,  is a female novel.  I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it;  I\'m simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed  this book in a very vehement manner. and I know it won\'t be too long before  I pick it up again.  Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she  wrote this one!  Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot  on my bookshelf.
