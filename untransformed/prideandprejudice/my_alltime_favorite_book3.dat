I feel sorry for the young person who thought this book was boring.  What a shame that you can\'t relax and stop thinking about yourself long enough to take the time to revel in one of the greatest works in English  literature.The plot is timeless, and I can guarantee that many of the  characters will resemble people you know.  Yes, the dialogue may be  difficult to follow at first but, after a while, "listening" to  it becomes almost second nature.I first read this book when I was 11 or  12, and have read it at least 10 or 15 times since, including at least  twice for school.  In fact, I chose to read it again just so I could write  a paper on it.Buy this book, sit down and lose yourself in Jane Austen\'s  world. Then try Persuasion, Emma or Sense &amp; Sensibility (I\'m afraid I  can\'t recommend Mansfield Park very highly).  If you have any trace of  imagination, you will be hooked.Please, do yourselves a favor and read  the book before seeing any of the adaptations.  Each has its advantages,  but the recent BBC/A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is a  sight to behold.  The Garvie/Rintoul version is also good, but not quite as  beautiful to watch.  It pains me to say this, but the Greer Garson/Laurence  Olivier version is far and away the weakest.
