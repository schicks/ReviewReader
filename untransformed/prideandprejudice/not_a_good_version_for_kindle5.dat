Note to all Kindle users - there are some books that are meant to be read on the Kindle and some that must have just been scanned into the computer.  This version is in the latter group.  It\'s AWFUL.  Sometimes you only get half a screen, other times the text is different sizes.  It has no table of contents for navigation.  I love the book, I hate the version.
