If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen\'s Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice.  Unfortuanately that was not the case.  I loved it nonetheless.  Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters  that makes for very enjoyable reading.  It does not read as quickly or  as  easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have  seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the  basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen\'s novel, which was  published in the 1800s.  The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and  should be viewed after reading the novel, not before.  It would make the  reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite  of her small English town of Highbury.  She is beautiful and wealthy and  popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to  be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to.  She is not terribly smart  but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman\'s  journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in  everyone\'s lives.  Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about.  I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against  reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not  hesitate to read it.  And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the  ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place  in my heart and on my bookshelf.
