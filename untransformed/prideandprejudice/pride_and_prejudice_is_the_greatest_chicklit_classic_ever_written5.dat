Miss Jane Austen (1775-1816) was born into the home of a clergyman at Steventon Rectory, She is the gem of all English authors in the realm of domestic romance and comedy. Jane needs a few middle class and wealthy families living in a rural setting to set her genius afire. Pride and Prejudice published in 1813 is justly the most famous, liveliest and perfectly plotted of all her few novels. You must read Pride and Prejudice if you have any claim to being a well educated person. The book is the grandmother of all the thousands of books that have been set in the Regency period featuring a love story between a young lady and a rich Byronic hero.  None of these books can match Pride and Prejudice in its witty dialogue and insights into the human heart.  The main characters are:The Bennet Family-Mr. Bennet is a fuddy-duddy bookworm of a clergyman. He is a poor father more interested in spending time in his study than it helping raise his rambunctious girls.Mrs. Bennet is a fatuous fool. An ignorant, self-indulgent, flippant idiot she has one goal-getting her five unwed daughters wed in prosperous matches with the local gentry and soldiery.Jane Bennet is the oldest "Miss Bennet". She falls in love with Mr. Bigley. She is an innocent, sweet young lady.Elizabeth Bennet is the novel\'s heroine and the most delightful young woman in all of English fiction! She is witty, wise, lively and beautiful. Elizabeth is probably based on Jane Austen. Her love is for Mr.Fitzwilliam Darcy whom she is preudiced against due to what she perceives as his rudeness to her; his suppposed effort to break up the affair between Jane and Darcy and his putative mistreatment of soldier Wickham.Lydia and Kitty are younger daughters who are man-crazy, brainless daughters. Lydia elopes with the cad soldier Wickham.Mary is the bookworm daughter who is made fun of by Austen for her overly serious demeanor.Charles Bingley-the love interest of Jane Bennet.Fitzwilliam Darcy is the prideful scion of great wealth who falls in love with Elizabeth. He resembles characters in such fictional products as those penned by Samuel Richardson; Fanny Burney and women authors enjoyed by the young Jane Austen.Hilarious minor characters include the odious clergyman Mr. Collins who weds the impecunious Charlotte Lucas. Charlotte is on the verge of becoming an old main so she weds the ludicrous Collins. Collins had earlier proposed marriage to Elizabeth but had been refused.Lady Catherine DeBourgh-Darcy\'s aunt she is cruel and hateful to everyone she holds in disdain. She is one of those old dragons which populate the pages of great classic English fiction.  The novel was written during the period of England\'s life and death struggle against Napoleon but there is no mention of the nation\'s affairsAusten keeps her keen but restricted focus on the lives of her ordinary people living in the retired village of Maryton.  Many famous novelists list Jane Austen as their favorite author. No wonder this is true! Janeites have adored her beautiful writing and well crafted stories for generations! Enjoy!
