This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing.  The characters are so vivid and they stay with you.  The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself.  Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride.  The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it\'s a jouney everyone should take.  Even if you have seen the great A&amp;E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book.  Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can\'t match Ms. Austens proes, it\'s such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all.
