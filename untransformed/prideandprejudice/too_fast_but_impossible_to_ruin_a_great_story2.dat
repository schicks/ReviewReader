This is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I have read it many times.  The main flaw in this reading is that it was too hurried.  There was barely a pause between chapters and the quick speech did not do justice to all of the characters.  I found the reader\'s voice to be as little high pitched and a little mannered, even for Austen.  Flaws aside, I still got enjoyment from this reading.  The speed became less distracting as I became used to it and there were some fine readings of exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy. Bottom line: not up to the standard that Pride and Prejudice deserves.
