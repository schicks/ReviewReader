Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality.  Good news!  The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell.  It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to.  There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago.  I found it very amusing to read Emma\'s antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters.  For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!
