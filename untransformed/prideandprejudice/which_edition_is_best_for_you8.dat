Being the literary classic that it is, you can purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice in a variety of shapes, sizes, and prices. No matter which one you chose it\'s still the perfect love story of Elizabeth Bennet (who every  woman wants to be) and Mr. Darcy (easily the sexiest literary character of  all time), witty and entertaining as well as significant in its portrayal  of femininity and other issues of the period in which it was written. It  may be just as good a story in the cheapest edition as in the most  expensive, but shelling out a couple extra dollars may get you more for  your money.If you\'re reading for a class or for independent study, you  can\'t go wrong (for this book or any other) with the Norton Critical  Edition. Includes not only the original text and info about the author, but  critical articles studying the novel from several different perspectives.  This edition could easily save you a trip to the library to find those  secondary sources you\'ll need for your research paper.If you\'re just  reading for pleasure or think the Norton Critical Edition is a little  pricey, your best bet is Penguin Classics. It\'s a well-edited version  that\'s appropriate for scholarly study, but it also offers those little  extras that make pleasure reading all the more pleasurable: endnotes that  will help you differentiate a post-chaise from a barouche and an  well-written and interesting introduction that looks at both influences on  Austen\'s writing and Pride and Prejudice as a classic romance (scholarly  enough to get you thinking, but not so much that it\'s boring or difficult  to understand). In my opinion the Penguin Classics edition is definitely  the best bet for your money.
