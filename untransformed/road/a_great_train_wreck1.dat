I have gotten more useless stars on my previous review in just a couple of days than I usually would get over the lifetime of a review, so I decided it must not have been very helpful.So I will just say that:-If you don\'t like Cormac McCarthy\'s short stories, particularly the style;-If you are not a fan of apocalyptic fiction, particularly that which focuses more on mood than psychology, setting or science;-If you find the southern gothic theme library depressing, or if, not being from the American South, you just find it hard to get into that level of grotesqueness and sheer despair;-If you read apocalyptic / science fiction for the setting and scientific pondering;you probably will not enjoy this book.On the other hand, it seems that a lot of people really enjoyed it. I personally do not find any redeeming qualities in repeatedly and dully recounting humanity\'s failures. Life\'s a piece of crap and then you die, or maybe not.Books I would recommend in lieu of this:Cormac McCarthy\'s short stories, if you want to get an idea of his work. They are shorter so you can break the depressing Southern Gothic and terse style into manageable chunks.Galapagos, by Kurt Vonnegut, for a modern post-apocalyptic scenario with an absurd but hopeful (though unpredictable) ending.A Fine Balance, Rohinton Mistry, for a book on the human spirit in the face of all odds.The Long Walk, for a book about a long walk in the face of physical, psychological, and other obstacles.For Southern Gothic, I have no recommendations. I don\'t like it.I know that many people love this book. Keep in mind that although you and I disagree, I am still providing information about the book that can be useful to people who have not yet decided whether to buy it. That is my purpose. I\'m not trying to malign McCarthy or your personal taste, but to give a review from a different point of view.
