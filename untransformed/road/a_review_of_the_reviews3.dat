First, let me say that I would place _Blood Meridian_ in the top five 20th century American novels, along with _The Grapes of Wrath_, and _Sometimes a Great Notion_.  Second, I borrowed the audio version of _The Road_, which allowed me to bypass the issues that some readers had with dialogue and punctuation.  Narrator Tom Stechschulte does a wonderful job animating very difficult material.  I highly recommend the audio version.  First audio book I\'ve listened to like this, but the story lends itself well to lying in bed with one\'s eyes closed just listening to the haunting tale.  Third, I am a huge fan of dystopian science fiction, and apocalyptic tales in general.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because it\'s not perfect, nor nearly the masterpiece of _Blood Meridian_.CONTAINS SPOILERSI read through every review on Amazon to date.  This is obviously difficult material.  It shows in the divergence of opinions. I\'m going to ignore the negative comments due to the depressiveness of the subject matter.  This is one of the most bleak stories I\'ve ever encountered.  It holds no punches about humanity.  The themes of man\'s inhumanity to man are equally as evident in _Blood Meridian_, which is in many ways a better book.  In many ways, McCarthy appears to have stripped off most of the excesses in BM and really pushed this book towards the questions of humanity, compassion, and hope.Some people just don\'t "get it".  For all the complaints of lack of convention, the story is quite conventional.  McCarthy is dealing in archetypes.  The parallels to _Lone Wolf and Cub_ that somebody mentioned in the discussions are apt.  The reasons for the apocalypse are as inconsequential as the audio gear on the shelves of the stores that these characters enter.  Why are some of you getting caught up in the why?  It could have been the Christian Rapture, valcanoes, meteors, nuclear weapons, the Mayan Calendar, aliens.  It just doesn\'t matter.  You bring to it your own interpretation.  Focus on what he does describe, as there\'s the wealth.The names of the father and son are unimportant, and I don\'t get why some readers got so hung up on that point.  Call the father Dean Moriarity (Neal Cassady) from _On The Road_, off on some wild hallucinatory experience in the future.  It just doesn\'t matter what their names are.  It\'s almost better we don\'t get them.  These are mythical characters we\'re dealing with on one hand, and everyman and his son on the other.  It\'s not surprising that more than one father noted a great emotional connectedness in his review.Others seem to be seeking far more action, and less repetition.  The story about the clan of marauders with the red scarves, pikes, and slaves is another story.  So is the story about the cellar of human food.  These seem to be the stories that some lusted for.  Instead the story you get is about the dull monotony of survival.  Notice that the greatest level of detail in the story is applied to the four necessities of survival: water, food, shelter, movement.  The first three of those are obvious.McCarthy does an adequate job of describing that for the father, staying put for too long was anethema.  Movement avoided stasis, and allowed them to continue to search for food supplies.  Remaining in one place for too long in such a society would only make one a target.  Staying at the bunker wouldn\'t have solved any problems, except for passing the time.  I believe that movement in space was far more important to the father than movement in time.  In some ways, this was how he kept up hope for the both of them.The son kept up hope, by showing compassion for humanity that the disillusioned father could no longer muster.  I think it\'s also a bit too extreme to label the father as a "bad guy".  Perhaps he wasn\'t the "goodest" of "good guys", but he was a survivor.  He wasn\'t interested in bothering anyone else, and seemed to almost practice the Golden Rule in reverse ... doing unto others as they had or showed intentions of doing onto them.  Hence forcing the thief at the end to strip, as they had been deprived of their clothing and left to die.  The ending was ambiguous enough to lend itself to multiple interpretations, but generally was a lot more hopeful than most of the rest of the story.
