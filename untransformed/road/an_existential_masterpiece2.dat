On the surface, McCarthy\'s book seems very straightforward - pared down dialogue, straightforward situations, and minimal plot. That\'s because he has far greater ambitions. The reviewers here who complained that the book doesn\'t have a plot, or that McCarthy is rehashing old themes, just don\'t get it. Harlequin romances and murder mysteries need good plots. Great literature doesn\'t. Like Shakespeare and Sophocles, McCarthy uses old themes and narratives to craft an original interpretation of the human condition.This is far more than just a compelling story. McCarthy has written a profound work of literature which rips into the deepest layers of our subconscious hopes and fears. It can be read on many levels, from existential philosophy (revisiting Camus\' old question - why don\'t we just kill ourselves?) to religious allegory, from social critique (all of the world\'s money and consumer goods have ultimately become meaningless) to a dark satire of Kerouac\'s road literature. The dialogue is very straightforward, but at times the narration soars. Parts of this book are nothing less than poetry, adamantine and pure.This isn\'t a cheerful little page turner to read by the pool. I had terrible nightmares after I read this book. That\'s because it got deep inside me, disturbed me, and challenged me. It isn\'t warm and cuddly, but great books rarely are.
