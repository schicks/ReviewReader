Other reviewers have summarized the story line admirably. The most telling comment was by the reviewer who said it is just so damn real. End time/ apocalyptic stories such as "The Stand" can be moving and thought provoking, but this one is traumatizing. In a world where all is lost and men are either predators or skulking scavengers a young boy on the verge of starvation insists on sharing their meager rations with a half crazed, dying bum. How poignant is that? Yet it is so symbolic of that special trait that makes humans a unique species: an almost congenital empathy, most pure in children. It is a trait that\'s so precious and endearing and possibly unique in time and space. Never have I seen it shown in such a heart wrenching way. Also the constant and almost painful love of father for son, the absolutely unhesitating willingness to sacrifice anything for the loved, even one\'s very life,is portrayed with stark, believable reality. Any parent will be reading with their heart in their throat. I love Cormac McCarthy and he\'s never been better. The book hits hard and you will be changed. Reading it is an adventure not for the faint of heart, but hugely rewarding for those with the grit to make the journey.
