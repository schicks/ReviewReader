Recently I read The Road.  Only later did I discover that it is a member of Oprah\'s Book Club.  That hurt my heart, but I still quite enjoyed the book.It is bleak and beautiful.  If you liked Song of Stone then give it a shot.  A couple of lines I liked:"By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.""There is no later. This is later. All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one\'s heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes."The book doesn\'t have a totally depressing ending but it\'s not a feel-good Hollywood ending either.  It will certainly make you appreciate our current ability to take for granted being warm, well fed, and safe.  McCarthy has an odd writing style that favors sentence fragments but it suits the tone of the book.  Check it out, especially if you like post-apocalyptic fiction.
