I read this entire book in about 5-6 hours. It is most definitely a page-turner. It is a very dark book. McCarthy is very good at creating an atmosphere, and this darkened, post-apocalyptic world draws you in completely. There are a few scenes that will stay with you for a very long time, whether you want them to or not. As the book says, "Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever." I can think of one scene in particular that I attempted to forget as soon as I read and it won\'t go away. The ending seems very abrupt, coincidental, and forced, and some of the circumstances throughout the book a little iffy. In my mind, this book is a little over-hyped, but that is not to say you should not read it. It is a good, well-written book that will make your heart rate jump a couple of times and it does a great job of pulling you in.
