This book is one of the bleakest, most honest books I have ever read.  If the apocolypse comes I hope to not survive as I think this book accurately depicts what life would look like afterwards.  After reading the book I am in no way interested in watching the movie as their is no way Hollywood wouldn\'t destroy the essence of this book, it would end up being a happy story that makes the demise of the world seem like it would be tolerable...But be careful reading as the book kind of stays with you and it continues to creep up in your mind.Easy read....I considered it to be the best book that made me feel sick to my stomach reading...I consider it a must read.
