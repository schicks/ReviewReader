Whew!  THE ROAD is a draining, exhausting, bleak, gut-wrenching, bleak, fast-paced, bleak novel.  Did I mention it was BLEAK?The book is 279 pages and they fly by.  I think I read the book in 4 hours...I could hardly make myself put it down.  I wouldn\'t say I "enjoyed" reading it...but it was thoroughly gripping, as spare and uncompromising a novel as you would ever want to read.It tells the story of a post-apocalyptic world, where the sun is never seen because the atmosphere is covered by ash.  Ash that has painted the world gray, killed all plant life and probably all animals.  More specifically, it is the story of a father and son ("the Man" and "the Boy") who are traveling on foot to the coast, pushing a shopping cart with their meager belongings.  They move slowly, are almost always near starvation and must constantly be on the alert for cannibalistic bands of humans who will stop at NOTHING to stay alive.The book is mostly a day-to-day depiction of the mundane yet important tasks they go through to stay alive.  Filtering water.  Finding clean blankets or new shoes.  Eating seeds or long decayed apples.  Never talking about the past.The boy, whose age we don\'t know, but I would guess around 8...has never seen the world as it was.  His father tries to blot out his memories and tries to come to grips with the fact that the world he is trying to survive in has no hope.  The two talk often of how preferable death would be...yet they fight hard to stay alive.It is the story of the love between the two...although the word "love" is never articulated.  It is a survival story...but the while the plot hinges a great deal on foraging for food, the heft of the story comes from their scrambling towards a psychological / mental survival.  How can the human spirit endure having nothing to live for?The recent movie CHILDREN OF MEN depicted a society crumbling under the weight of knowing that no more children would be born.  They had nothing to live for, because there was nothing to pass on.  THE ROAD takes this feeling and amplifies it to an almost intolerable degree.The story has brief moments of respite, when things go reasonably well for a short time.  It\'s amazing what a relief these moments are...because the rest of the book is BLEAK.  (The last couple of pages offer the absolute tiniest smidgens of what might be taken for hope.  That\'s as "happy" as it\'s gonna get.)I just finished the book yesterday, but I know I\'ll have a hard time shaking the feeling it left me with.  While this is not an easy book to endure...it is very well written and it is an amazing achievement.  Its perceptions of the state of these two main characters is so convincing.  I highly recommend the book, even to a younger audience (say about 13 and above.)  There\'s no bad language, it\'s very fast moving and I think could change the way a young person feels about the power of books to leave an important impact on their lives.
