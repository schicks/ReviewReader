In THE ROAD Cormac McCarthy creates a nightmarish apocalyptic vision of a country wrecked by some unnamed upheaval. McCarthy is not the first writer to portray a wasted landscape, but what marks this novel as special is his ability to keep the reader involved in a story that is as nearly devoid of plot as any book I have read. An unnamed man and his young son tread the United States seeking food and survival in a time and place that offer very little hope of achieving either.  From the first page to the last, they walk, they talk, and very occasionally encounter other survivors.  Yet, it is a disservice to literature to expect that any novel must follow traditional lines of character development, plot complication, and other areas that we normally expect to find. THE ROAD is thus not a plot driven work.  It is theme propelled, with the careful reader being rewarded with what seems to be ordinary conversation but instead the duo\'s comments to each other reveal a breathtaking universe of despair that is only slightly leavened by an ending that suggests that even in this blighted landscape of crunching loneliness there is a smidgeon of optimism that not even a nuclear winter can crush.As I read THE ROAD I was reminded of the similar bleak countryside of Walter Van Tillburg Clark\'s much anthologized short story, THE PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH. In both works, Clark and McCarthy allow the landscape to speak and act as eloquently as any human can.  Where Clark\'s atom blasted United States suggests a continuity of human compassion, McCarthy delves more deeply into the morass of nihilism that does not allow its inhabitants to know for sure what distinguishes the good guys from the bad.  The son often questions his father as to whether they are good when he sees that his father is quite willing to kill others merely to ensure their own survival.  Such questions strike directly at the core of what it is to be human.  McCarthy provides no easy answers as the father drills his son with the needed mentality to be a survivor.Then there is the blighted land itself.  Nowhere in the book does the sun shine brightly.  Instead a corrosive grayness covers all.  The duo often have trouble even seeing clearly for a short distance. Rain is frequent and chilling.  It is as if nature itself has turned against humanity by creating an anti-Eden from which all fruit has been banned.  It matters little whether this blight originated from massive nuclear strikes or asteroid collisions.  What matters more is how the very few survivors manage to live while maintaining a bare semblance of what they used to call humanity.  Even their clipped conversations are fragmented.  Language has become as crippled as the humans walking on their Road that starts nowhere and leads nowhere. THE ROAD then is a truly nightmarish vision of a world gone mad, and no one can retain either his sanity or his normalcy.  The reader is luckier.  He can close the book to see the sun and ponder how thin is the line between this world and that.
