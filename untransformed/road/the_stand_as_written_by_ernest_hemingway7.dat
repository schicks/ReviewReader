or, The Novel Stephen King Would Write If He Were A Genius***I just finished THE ROAD last night and am still trying to sort my feelings on the book out, so I trust you\'ll forgive the somewhat disjointed nature of this review.I wrote down a bunch of words/phrases that came immediately to mind upon finishing the novel. Here are some of them:Tragic. Bleak. Brutal. Cosmic horror [Google it]. Gallows humor in the dialogue. Hemingwayesque. Hard for parents. Hard for children. Hard to take in general. Sad, sad, sad.Sounds pretty bad, doesn\'t it? Considering that this is a novel about the (literal) autophagia of the human race, did you really expect any different?I\'m making this book sound awful. It isn\'t. It\'s brilliant and it\'s incredibly moving. It\'s just that McCarthy puts his characters in an incredibly grim situation and pulls no punches in telling us about it. Reading THE ROAD makes you realize just how silly and ephemeral most fiction really is. To give it less than 5 stars would be an enormous injustice.
