In J.D. Salinger\'s brilliant coming-of-age novel, Holden Caulfield, a seventeen year old prep school adolescent relates his lonely, life-changing twenty-four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of  the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger  brother, an overwhelming compulsion to lie and troubling sexual  experiences.Salinger, whose characters are among the best and most  developed in all of literature has captured the eternal angst of growing  into adulthood in the person of Holden Caulfield.  Anyone who has reached  the age of sixteen will be able to identify with this unique and yet  universal character, for Holden contains bits and pieces of all of us.  It  is for this very reason that The Catcher in the Rye has become one of the  most beloved and enduring works in world literature.As always,  Salinger\'s writing is so brilliant, his characters so real, that he need  not employ artifice of any kind.  This is a study of the complex problems  haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Salinger wisely  chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple.This  is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and simple  book.  It is anything but.  In it we are privy to Salinger\'s genius and  originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner.  The  Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and understood on many  different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will  come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live.A work of  true genius, images of a catcher in the rye are abundantly apparent  throughout this book.While analyzing the city raging about him, Holden\'s  attention is captured by a child walking in the street "singing and  humming."  Realizing that the child is singing the familiar refrain,  "If a body meet a body, comin\' through the rye," Holden, himself,  says that he feels "not so depressed."The title\'s words,  however, are more than just a pretty ditty that Holden happens to like.  In  the stroke of pure genius that is Salinger, himself, he wisely sums up the  book\'s theme in its title.When Holden, whose past has been traumatic, to  say the least, is questioned by his younger sister, Phoebe, regarding what  he would like to do when he gets older, Holden replies, "Anyway, I  keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of  rye and all.  Thousands of little kids, and nobody\'s around--nobody big, I  mean--except me.  And I\'m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I  have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I  mean if they\'re running and they don\'t look where they\'re going.  I have to  come out from somewhere and catch them.  That\'s all I\'d do all day.  I\'d  just be the catcher in the rye and all.  I know it\'s crazy, but that\'s the  only thing I\'d really like to be."In this short bit of dialogue  Salinger brilliantly exposes Holden\'s deepest desire and expounds the  book\'s theme.  Holden wishes to preserve something of childhood innocence  that gets hopelessly lost as we grow into the crazy and phony world of  adulthood.The theme of lost innocence is deftly explored by Salinger  throughout the book.  Holden is appalled when he encounters profanity  scrawled on the walls of Phoebe\'s school, a school that he envisions  protecting and shielding children from the evils of society.When Holden  gives his red hunting cap to Phoebe to wear, he gives it to her as a  shield, an emblem of the eternal love and protectiveness he feels for  her.Near the beginning of the book, Holden remembers a girl he once  knew, Jane Gallagher, with whom he played checkers.  Jane, he remembers,  "wouldn\'t move any of her kings," and action Holden realizes to  be a metaphor of her naivete.  When Holden hears that his sexually  experienced prep school roommate had a date with Jane, he immediately  starts a fight with him, symbolically protecting Jane\'s innocence.More  sophisticated readers might question the reasons behind Holden\'s plight.  While Holden\'s feelings are universal, this character does seem to be a  rather extreme example.  The catalyst for Holden\'s desires is no doubt the  death of his younger brother, Allie, a bright and loving boy who died of  leukemia at the age of thirteen.  Holden still feels the sting of Allie\'s  death acutely, as well as his own, albeit undeserved, guilt, in being able  to do nothing to prevent Allie\'s suffering.The only reminder Holden  has of Allie\'s shining but all-too-short life, is Allie\'s baseball mitt  which is covered with poems Allie read while standing in the outfield.  In  a particularly poignant moment, Holden tells us that this is the glove he  would want to use to catch children when they fall from the cliff of  innocence.In an interesting, but trademark, Salinger twist, Holden  distorts the Robert Burns poem that provides the book\'s title.  Originally,  it read, "If a body meet a body, comin\' through the rye."  Holden  distorts the word "meet" into "catch."  This is  certainly not the first time Holden is guilty of distortion; indeed he is a  master at it.This distortion, however, shows us how much Allie\'s death  has affected Holden and also how much he fears his own fall from innocence,  the theme that threads its way throughout the whole of the book.By this  amazing book\'s end, we must reach the conclusion that there are times when  we all need a "catcher in the rye."  We are, indeed, blessed if  we have one.
