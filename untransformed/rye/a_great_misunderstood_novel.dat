While reading other reviews on this site, I find myself saddened by two problems people have with this book: 1) nothing exciting ever happens 2) Holden Caulfield is merely a cynical whiner In response to those who hold the first as a fault of the Catcher in the Rye, perhaps you should learn a greater appreciation for literature and the human soul. In this age of  shallow films and pulp Stephen Kingesque fiction, people seem more  concerned with cheap, "action-packed" thrills, and (not to sound  like Holden or anything) it is depressing to see that people are unable to  be moved by a book unless it involves a homicidal clown or a rebellious  Soviet submarine. In response to those who feel that Holden is just a  mindless cynic, I feel as if you have failed to see what lied beneath his  very blunt (though often true) observations of the numerous rituals that  are plentiful in American society. After finishing the book, Holden did not  seem to be a cynic, but rather a figure of both youthful desperation and  enlightened sympathy. He was by no means just an ass for he saw beauty  in such innocent things as his little sister\'s joy while riding a carousel  and the strange excitement felt by a humble drummer as he prepares to play  a few, almost meaningless notes, and reflecting upon such things, one is  lead to the belief that Holden, deep within his heart, wishes not to merely  criticize but to help others by showing them the pointless suffering caused  by their own arrogance (a self-glorifying form of cynicism) and  self-centered attitudes. Thus, it can be concluded that it is not Holden  who is insane, but the world itself. Holden sees through their insanity,  and criticizes the disease, not the diseased.
