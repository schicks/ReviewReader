"Catcher in the Rye" portrayed the suffering and alienation of an otherwise privileged, middle-class young man long before such a theme became fashionable. So much of today\'s writing with comparable themes seems  like a tepid imitation of the original.Holden Caulfield is an utterly  convincing character who is not reaching out from the pages and trying to  grab our sympathy. Salinger should be commended for not endowing Caulfield  with bathos and excessive sadness. Instead, he presents Caulfield\'s state  of mind in a simple, lucid narrative. As a result, this novel is very  effective in examining timeless questions about the nature of happiness and  the conflict between the individual and society. There is also a compelling  honesty in Salinger\'s writing that makes Caulfield so believable that I  frequently forget he is a fictional character.This book should be read  by young people and adults alike. It should also be read by aspiring  writers attempting to market their own tales of woe.
