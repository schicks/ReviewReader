A catcher. It\'s actually a misquote explained in the book. Now if you\'ve read some of these bad reveiws you\'re probably all set move on to another book, but there\'s hope. First you have to understand Salinger writes most  of his stories like a puzzle and its up to the reader to figure it out. If  you take the book at face value all you get is a confusing mess about a  teen age boy. If you dig a little beneath the surface you find the story of  a boy coming to terms with adulthood and growing up. His little sister  Phoebe is the childhood essence, his dead brother Allie symbolizes never  growing old, and Being a catcher in the rye is his desire to save children  from the pains of adulthood. It does a good job of explaining a teenagers  view of the adult life and childhood and the pain of being stuck in  between. as for the story being depressing, if you realise that Holden, the  main character, is happy in the end, willing to grow up, youd see its not  depressive. As for those who says he just needs help and they couldnt  relate, perhaps they should have read it when they were 16 or perhaps they  should read it again. Look for the clues and youll realise the story is  being told in some sort of institution were Holden is resting. The  character isnt perfect, isnt overly likeably but that\'s what makes the  story so great. It\'s a look at one mans real life, not a happily-ever-after  story. A great book for anyone whos secure enough to read to learn, but not  for anyone who reads to escape
