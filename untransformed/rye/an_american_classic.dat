It is difficult to remember what it was like to read this book for the first time.  It is also difficult to imagine a book where each new reading provides so much more illumination into the main character and his personality.  I can remember finding Catcher to be funny the first time I read it.  I now alternately find Holden to be walking a fine line between witty sarcasm and dangerous cynicism.  He is funny, there is no way around that, but his belittling nature also causes him to dismiss much from his life that may not be perfect, but should be included.  There is nothing that he, in the end, does not dismiss as being phony, whether it is the nuns with whom he shares a cup of coffee, the teacher at the end who most likely was just trying to help, the Egyptian wing of the museum, Pheobe\'s school...everything.  As soon as one little detail slips in which is not completely on track with what he is thinking whatever it is he is contemplating becomes useless, phony, not worth dealing with.  His humor is sharp and witty and I often laugh out loud while reading, but it is also an easy way for him to detach himself from a world which he no longer feels he belongs in, or wants to belong in. I can remember finding the ending ambiguous the first time I read it.  I now see it as the only way it could end, with Holden finding happiness watching his sister Pheobe going forever in circles, and being able to pretend that that is never going to change.  She is the one thing in his life which he still deems worthy of existence, and placing her on a merry-go-round is his best attempt to keep her there.  Things change and grow and move on, but Holden refuses to accept this and is yearning to stop things forever where they are, to go back to when D.B. was a writer full of dreams and Allie was still alive.  He mentions once how he used to take field trips to the museum, but how it was never the same and that takes something away from it.  Even if the exhibit was the same, YOU would be different, simply by having traveled a bit farther in life, and this is what Holden is incapable of dealing with.  The ending is Holden trying to keep the one thing in his life he still truly loves exactly the way she is. I can remember finding Holden\'s journey to be a bit all over the place.  I now can see that there is not a single detail which Salinger does not use to illuminate Holden.  On Holden\'s last night at school everything is covered with snow.  He stands there holding a snowball looking for something to throw it at, but he can not bring himself to throw his snowball and disturb a fire hydrant or a park bench.  Everything is peaceful under the snow and Holden can not bring himself to alter this just as he can not handle a world that keeps changing.  Or there is Holden\'s history class, which he is failing.  The only topic he is remotely interested in is the Egyptians and their process of mummification.  The only thing he cares about is how to preserve things just as they are.  I can remember enjoying this book the first time I read it.  But I had no idea that with each subsequent reading I would find more and more to enjoy, and more and more evidence of Salinger\'s genius.
