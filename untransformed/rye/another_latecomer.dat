Count me with those who came to this book late in life (my Catholic High School taught us "A Separate Peace" instead). I was hoping for something more.I would have loved to read a book that captured teenage angst and the dread of growing older and making compromises.  But Holden just repeats the same thing incessantly: "They\'re all phony and depressing."  He doesn\'t in any way seem representative of what most teens go through.  Rather, he just comes off as one very messed up kid.  It feels more like an early picture of mental illness - of someone dealing with depression or OCD - than anything to do with the human condition. He then goes on to lie to virtually everyone, killing any of hope of the reader being able to sympathize with a main character who is so deceptive.As it became clear that nothing was going to happen plotwise, I hoped for at least some movement - some deeper understanding of Holden\'s situation.  But all I got was: "They\'re all phony and depressing" - applied to virtually every situation.  You do end up wanting to slap him and say, "Wake up!"  I was hoping that someone would confront him, to make him take a hard look at himself, to have him learn &gt;something&lt; but nothing changes.  In truth, you could read the first third of the novel and get the whole picture.I wish I had spent the time reading something else.
