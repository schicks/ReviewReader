When reading The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, you should keep in mind that it takes place in the late forties. Customs and the way people go about things were very different than they are now. Or, maybe it\'s just the way Holden, the main character, reacts to the events in his life.  The Catcher in the Rye is about a seventeen-year-old boy, Holden, who drops out of prep school, without telling his parents. This leads to him hanging around New York City in the days preceding Christmas break. He is your typical rebelling teenage boy. He tends to use lots or crude language and enjoys rather large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Some common phrases Holden uses are: "For Chrissake", "Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing?", "Jesus! What the hell happened to you!", "That depressed the hell outta me", and "Goddamnit!". Although, when faced with the opportunity for a prostitute he takes it, but when she arrives, he can\'t bring himself to commit the act. That seems to be the only real commendable thing about Holden. The only other thing that I liked about this book was the relationship Holden had with his younger sister, Phoebe. Here is a quote that shows how Holden cares for Phoebe. "I\'m going with you. Can I? Okay? Please." "No. Shut up. You\'re not going. Now, shut up." This is the part where Holden decides he is going to go out west and Phoebe wants to go with him, but he won\'t let her. This caring feeling that Holden has for Phoebe also comes through in other parts of the book.At the end, problems are solved, but not in a reasonable or logical manner.I didn\'t get much of anything out of this book at all. There\'s really no lesson learned, point or objective and not much of a happily ever after either. Personally, this book could and should have lasted much longer. The author could have spend more time really getting to the bottom of Holden\'s problems and telling more about how things turned out for Holden. It just seems like he got tired of writing the book and took the easy way out. The last chapter: "That\'s all I\'m going to tell you about. I could probably tell you about what I did after I went home, how I got sick and all, and what school I\'m supposed to go to next fall, after I get out f here, but I don\'t feel like it. I really don\'t. That stuff doesn\'t really interest me too much right now." This book may be considered a classic, but I don\'t see what makes it that way.
