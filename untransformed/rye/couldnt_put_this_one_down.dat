I\'ve never even come close to reading this classic by J.D. Salinger until I picked up this cheap little copy a few days ago. My only knowledge of the book came from Mark David Chapman and the killing of John Lennon two decades ago. I sat down with it right away and quickly became engrossed in the story told by narrator and main character Holden Caulfield. It\'s absolutely incredible that this was written in 1951. The language is slangy and fresh enough to make anyone believe that it was written close to today.The book is an account of a few days in the life of Holden Caulfield, teenager and cynic. Caulfield gets kicked out of his prep school and wanders around New York City for a few days, trying to avoid his parents and having a few interesting encounters along the way. All of these events are related to use directly through Holden\'s worldview. This worldview is depressingly downbeat, as Holden views most who tramp through this world as "phonies". To use one of Holden\'s favorite phrases, what "killed me" about this book is Salinger\'s ability to transform extremely arcane sensations and emotions into prose. When Caulfield talks about his dead brother Allie, he mentions how red his hair was. To show the reader how red it was, Holden talks about a day he was golfing and turned around and saw Allie about 150 yards away watching him. Great imagery! I could actually see his red hair while I was reading this. I loved Caulfield\'s hunting cap, the imagery of his being the catcher in the rye, and the ducks and frozen fish in Central Park. All point at Caulfield as something deeper than an angst-addled teenager slumming through New York. Caulfield is on a quest to save kids from his own fate. He achieves this in a sense at the end with his kid sister Phoebe.I\'m thirty years old, which is still young enough to understand how Holden feels. I went through a stage where I felt exactly like Holden. Everybody does to some extent, I think. The trick is to survive it and not let it destroy you. I really thought this book would end on a bad note, but it seemed uplifting in a way. Read this book, if for nothing else then to say you\'ve read it. Once you get started on this one, you will have a tough time putting it down. Recommended.
