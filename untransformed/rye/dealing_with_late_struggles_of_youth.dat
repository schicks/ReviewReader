One scene that has always stuck in my mind in "It\'s A Wonderful Life" is when George Bailey and his future wife were talking and George was taking his time on making his move to kiss her for the first time, when in the background an old man said "Well are you going to kiss her or not, ahh youth is wasted on the young." To my way of thinking many classic novels which we as in our youth had to read and study and be tested on in high school and later in college, were actually never really fully understood or appreciated.  To me, I was told to read these books and later the teacher or the professor would lecture and have active discussions in detail of the nuances and literal and figurative interpretations on the intentions of the author and the real plot of what the author was trying to convey to the reader. The better students would learn the triggers of success and mimic their instructor\'s persuasions and add "a little" of how the novel affected them in their young lives.  But my take on many of these classics actually confused me and being the rebellious student that I was I usually didn\'t go with the program and in many instances took my rebellion in the force of protest and usually ended up with an old-fashioned hook a C.  I did the same thing when I first read "Catcher in the Rye" in fact being very much like Holden Caulfield in my studies of this novel. The fact remains that as one grows older one gains from life experiences and is able to appreciate life on a wider and more knowledgeable scale.  I have spent most of my academic life reading and writing of history and life memoirs of things that have actually happened.  My studies were based on things that have happened.  However I find myself being brought back to the classics and with that added maturity, I have found out that I do indeed understand them better. J. D. Salinger was really writing of his youth when he wrote this book.  Holden Caulfield is a dysfunctional youth who in all reality hates the concept of growing up and following teacher or parental guidance or instruction.  Being born to wealth and surrounded by siblings who all seemed to be normally adjusted youths, Holden held out to be the family "black sheep."  The traumatic effect of his younger brother\'s death had deeply disturbed Holden. In fact this event may have started the trigger that he would rather remain a child and not grow up in the "phony" lifestyle of being an adult. The other key sibling that Holden held in very high regard was Phoebe who he regarded as not only as a sister but a person who personified the goodness in the essence of what youth is.  Simple and loving! The book is written in the first person by Holden Caulfield and it tells of his relationships with his classmates, teachers and his parents.  It is written in the mind of a seventeen year old which is contradictory, whimsical, funny, mad, nonsensical and at times very funny.  In fact it does represent the brain of a person who has not fully developed. To tell you the truth this writing in the vernacular of a teenager, represents the brilliance of Salinger\'s writing.  Some youth can adapt to the adult world and move on; others like Holden have a very hard time in doing so. My review intent is not to give away the meaning and plot of this classic book but to rather engage the reader to see that this book is indeed of deep meaning in which I never recognized 46 years ago.  The meaning of the title makes sense as it never did before and as an added insertion to my discoveries I found this book to coincide greatly with the story of "Peter Pan."  If you have never read the book do so.  If you read it as a young student, I daresay read it again, it will surprise you!!!!
