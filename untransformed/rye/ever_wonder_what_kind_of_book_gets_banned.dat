The entire story is narrated by Caulfield as he reflects back on a recent time in his life; taking place just after he is expelled from yet another prep school. It details his misadventures and observations of life from his outcast, and emotionally charged, perspective.The Good:First of all I just wanted to say this book is a classic written over 60 years ago with over 1.5 million ratings and nearly 35,000 reviews; and that\u2019s just on Goodreads. In other words, I more than likely won\u2019t say anything that someone hasn\u2019t already said hundreds, if not thousands, of times. In light of this, I\u2019m going to keep my review relatively short and to the point.First, to point out the elephant in the room, I love how relatable this book is, even 60+ years later. Teenage angst, in all it\u2019s many forms, is pretty much timeless. The Catcher In The Rye does a fantastic job at showing just how emotional and overwhelming that time of life can be. It\u2019s not prettied up to make it look like everything will be all right; it\u2019s raw and realistic. The issues are presented just as they feel to Holden, just as they feel to many teenagers. And even if you\u2019re not a teenager, and not able to relate to the book in the moment, you can reflect back and understand where he is coming from. For those who say \u201cI never felt like that\u201d, I get that, but I\u2019m sure you knew someone who did. It\u2019s not exclusive to how all people everywhere felt when they were Holden\u2019s age, but it is a good representation.I keep bringing this up, but this book was written over 60 years ago. To me, that\u2019s amazing. This is one of those books that, aside from a few words and phrases, doesn\u2019t feel like it was written more than 10 years ago. The Catcher In The Rye read like just about everything else nowadays, and I loved that. One of the reasons I don\u2019t read as many classics as I should is that I hate Shakespearean lingo, and stuff like it. For me, it takes away from the story. If I have to spend time trying to understand what\u2019s being said, as opposed to absorbing what\u2019s happening, it wouldn\u2019t be a book I\u2019d tend to lean towards. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons that story is as timeless as it is. Anybody could pick it up and understand what\u2019s going on.I thoroughly enjoyed the refreshingly raw look into a characters mind. Holden was troubled; he had his emotional demons. The fact that you\u2019re able to read his train of thought, to have such a vivid look at his mindset, that\u2019s what made it so special to me. One scene he\u2019s going along happy and go-lucky, and the next he\u2019s broken to the emotional core. That\u2019s life. When things get Holden down, J.D. Salinger shows us the effect, he doesn\u2019t just gloss over it. The emotional internal and spiritual struggles are real. The vulnerability is real.Finally, for all that this book is, I found it to be quite funny. Sure it was dry humor, but it still made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions. That\u2019s what keeps it from being too emotional, too heavy.The Bad:This is tough, because I really didn\u2019t see anything particularly wrong with this book. In fact the only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is because it didn\u2019t feel 5 star worthy to me. It\u2019s not one of those things where I could tell you what went wrong.I know some people have a problem with it because they find the character too negative, and too unrealistic. That\u2019s not an issue for me. I understand Holden as a character, even if I never really felt the way he did.I know people also disliked the fact that this book really didn\u2019t have a beginning or ending; but that\u2019s the point isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a book that centers on the life of a teenager, for only a brief period of time. It really couldn\u2019t have a true beginning or ending. It\u2019s all about the there and now. Sure it points to the future, but only in regards to the feelings it brings up at that moment.Other:While I was reading this book, all I kept thinking about was that it\u2019s a book about nothing. I mean yes at its core it\u2019s about all the things I\u2019ve mentioned above and many others, but generally speaking it\u2019s about nothing in particular. And yet it\u2019s so incredibly successful. Now why is that familiar? Oh yes, there was a little show about nothing; Seinfeld ring any bells? That was just a little successful too. In fact, if you look at it, you could say that Seinfeld is an adult version of this book, without as much emotional investment and more comedic value.I find quite humorous how ironic this book is. The thought of Holden being \u201cthe catcher in the rye\u201d, wanting to save children\u2019s innocence, save them from adulthood, all the while he\u2019s the one with Peter Pan syndrome. He\u2019s the one who wants to be a child.Overall:What can you say, The Catcher in the Rye is a classic any way you swing it. Love it or hate it, it\u2019s been around for over 60 years and I don\u2019t see that changing any time soon. It\u2019s won an insane amount of awards, been on almost every top 100 must-read list and is relatable through the generations. At this point, if you haven\u2019t already read it, just do it. You\u2019ll either love it, or you won\u2019t. I loved it, and can\u2019t recommend it enough. Would I say it changed my life? No, but I understand how it could. They don\u2019t call em classics for nothing.(www.FictionForesight.com)
