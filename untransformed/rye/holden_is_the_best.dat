This has been one of my favorites. Every time I return to it, I always seem to find something more in it. Structurally, it is challenging. Although the vocabulary is simple, the repetition of symbolic imagery makes this a complex read on one level. Holden\'s fascination with ducks, museums, and even bathrooms is intriguing. But on a personal level, Holden gives voice to all the things that we once thought but found too dificult to face square on. For example, what happens to our loved ones when they die? What is the meaning of life or the point to living? I think part of his answer is that the connections we have with those whom we love, although temporary, is what keeps us motivated to live. We want to see and be with those who mean the most to us. We want to see them happy and their happiness is what makes us happy. It took Holden a long time to figure this out. He contemplates suicide, escape, and even undergoes a mental breakdown. But the ending to me is positive in the sense that he foregoes his unrealistic desire for an ideal world, one without evil, and accepts the bad in order to enjoy the good this world offers. This book inspires those who think life is meaningless and offers them something to value in a world that sometimes seems to lack any value.
