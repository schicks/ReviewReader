When I went to college, with these aspirations for becoming an engineer, I ran into inner conflicts, making me feel confused and depressed. Somehow instinctively, I turned to Holden and a book that I had read several years earlier, but that had not made a significant impression then. Reading the novel again, it perhaps made me more desolate than I was before, and I dropped out of school a few months later.  SOme might say that the book, then, had a negative impact on me. One less engineer in the world. One less go-getter. But through the contemplation I did in the months after leaving college, and the inspiring example of an English teacher I had at my local community college, I was able to find the true direction of my spirit. I had to make my life into something that I truly saw as meaningful. I couldn\'t settle into a career that would not fulfill my desires.  I\'m writing this review from my teacher\'s desk at school in my classroom. I\'m an English teacher. I\'ve found my calling. And although I can\'t entirely say it was Catcher in the Rye that pointed the way for me, the provocations of thought and emotion that this poignant little novel provided me had a definite impact.  For those of you reading through the reviews here on Amazon and noting the great dichotomy of love and hate for this book, note that all great works of art have such an effect. Division is often the result of a work such as this. And I must say, no one should be forced to read this novel in school. It goes against the nature of the novel for us to cannonize Catcher and feed it to our youth as some sort of hallowed treatise on individualism and our flawed American society. Bleh! Leave it to be picked up by the curious and the lonely. Let it find its own audience.
