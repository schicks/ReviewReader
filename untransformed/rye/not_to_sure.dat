I just recently read The Catcher In the Rye for the first time, and I have to admit I really didn\'t get it. I am only fifteen and this is only my first time reading it so I am sure that with age and re-reading I might come to love this book and truly recognize why it is one of the most accomplished books in literature, but for right now I just didn\'t get it.What I liked about the book was that while Holden\'s outlook on life was negative and blunt, it was still funny and strangely true--even if we sometimes wouldn\'t want to admit it. I enjoyed laughing at his charasmatic, and sarcastic attitude, and his interpretations of the events around him.What I didn\'t like about the book was that, it was so repetative. True J.D. Salinger\'s whole point of repeating things was to help us get an idea of the character of Holden, but sometimes I found it boring to read his same opinion on something over and over. Also sometimes Holden\'s erratic train of thought was difficult to understand, I found myself having to read passages again to try and understand what Holden was trying to communicate.To wrap it all up, I was expecting that by the end of the book there would be some monumental conclusion on Holden\'s story to give this book such a reputation, but i was seriously disappointed when the story just sort of trailed off. I didnt understand. There was no point in the whole story.So anyways, I gave this book a three because of the things explained above and I hope that the next time I read this book I will understand it a little better.
