It\'s rare that a book with such social significance and impact comes along.  Although this book is now a classic - crafted by JD Salinger in 1951, it\'s message and importance is still relevant to this day.  The Catcher in the Rye is the story of 16 year-old Holden Caulfield, an  alienated teenager searching for meaning in life.  Holden\'s troubles range  from his poor school performance to the almost maddening feelings of  disgust he has toward the plethora of phony individuals that he must deal  with during the course of his day to day life.  The story, told from  Holden\'s point of view, takes us through Holden\'s mind, as well as the  locations he visits on his quest to find the meaning of his extentialist  purgatory.  A superbly written, no-bull account of the life of an  outcast teen, The Catcher in the Rye, in addition to entertaining us,  inspires us to think: to question our own existence and encourage ourselves  to be better people through compassion and understanding of the human  condition.  This book is a must read, especially for teenagers, as you WILL  find something in this novel that you can incorporate into your own  personality: something that you can make a part of you.
