The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger is a timeless classic in which a young boy tries to find himself while living in his Ivy League world. The young hero of the book, Holden Caufield, tries to reestablish a  relationship with his younger sister, and decide what he wants to make of  him self. Holden has been expelled from Pencey for academic  failure, and after an unpleasant evening with his self-satisfied roommate  Stadlater and their pimply next-door neighbor Ackley, he decides to leave  Pencey for good and spend a few days alone in New York City before  returning to his parents\' Manhattan apartment. Upon reading The  Catcher in the Rye I had high expectations. As I have never met a person  who has not only enjoyed the book, but has been able to relate themselves  to Holden, I only hoped that my expectations could be met. I read the book  with ease, the riveting plot keeping my attention, I not only realized that  my lofty goals would be met, but far surpassed. I have never before been  able to relate my self to a character such as Holden in Salinger \xeds  masterpiece.Holden \xeds witty humor and deep thoughts leave you in  disbelief of his personality. Is he a poor rich kid? Or a person trying to  discover himself before making the final steps into the real world? The  readers of the book will make their own opinion of why Holden seems to  suddenly have psychological breakdown at such an early age. Although Holden  is intelligent and sensitive, he narrates his story in a cynical, jaded  voice. Though he never says so outright, he longs to live in a beautiful  and innocent world, and finds the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world  around him almost unbearably painful.The Catcher in the Rye is not only  a timeless classic, but also a story about a young boy on the brink of  adulthood, finding the world full of hypocrisy and ugliness and wondering  how he will fit in.
