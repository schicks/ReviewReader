Even though this is a literary classic that almost everyone in America reads before graduating from High School, somehow I missed out on this one and was never required to read it for any class I took, even through college. I\'ve heard numerous references to it through the years. Before killing John Lennon, Mark Chapman, who read and re-read the book many times - to the point of believing it was his own biography, asked Lennon to autograph his copy before gunning down the musician. John Hinckley, attempted assassin of Ronald Reagan, was another devotee of the short novel, as was Robert Bardo, killer of Rebecca Schaeffer (star of "My Sister Sam" on TV). There may be countless other criminals and stalkers who have identified with the book\'s main character, Holden Caulfield.  In Mel Gibson\'s movie, "Conspiracy Theory," his character has an obsession with the book and must buy a copy every time he sees one.I finally had to pick up a copy and find out what all the fuss was about. Was the book about stalking and murder? Not exactly - but rather the motivating factor behind such heinous crimes of obsession.Caulfield, in his late teens, is a misfit in a world that doesn\'t tolerate misfits very well. His younger brother, who he dearly admired for being so likeable and genuine, has died of cancer. His older brother, D.B., lives in Hollywood, writing stories for the big screen, which is a loathsome thought for Caulfield.Caulfield is an introspective youth who hates being around fake people (who doesn\'t?), but doesn\'t try to get to know people well enough to find out whether they are really phony or not. He stumbles through life with his arms crossed in defiance, believing he\'s one of the few genuine people in the world.Growing up in an affluent home, being shuttled from one prep school to another, Caulfield finds himself ensconced with phonies and it makes him sick to his stomach. His refusal to acclimate results in him being kicked out of one school after another. The novel opens with his narrative of how he has been kicked out of Pencey, his latest prep school, and how he doesn\'t want to face his parents until they\'ve gotten the news and calmed down a bit.He heads up to New York, getting a room in a fleabag hotel, then running from bar to bar, trying to find something that won\'t bore him. He\'s obsessed with avoiding boredom at all costs.  He\'s constantly finding himself in situations where he fantasizes about killing people, but never defends himself because, he explains, he\'s "yellow."His inability to focus and attempt to express himself makes him frustrated and angry, finding contempt and hate for just about anyone for any reason, even those he loves.  The story takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of 2 and a half days as Holden Caulfield searches for meaning in his life, but finds only emptiness. The only thing he can seem to hold onto is the fantasy of building a cabin out in the middle of nowhere, where he never has to be around phonies again... he\'d rather be alone, than lonely in the midst of crowds of phony-baloneys.After reading the book, it\'s easy to understand how such misfits as Hinckley, Bardo and Chapman used this book as their personal anthem and almost as a proxy, felt the need to act out in ways that Holden Caulfield was unable or unwilling to do. To the sane reader, Caulfield\'s character is a study in sadness and loneliness, not a character worth admiring - albeit his search for the truth in life is a noble cause.The book doesn\'t condone or condemn Caulfield, but rather states Caulfield\'s thoughts as they come to him. The sane reader can\'t help but want to reassure Caulfield that this is part of growing up and everything is going to be ok, and wonder where such people were in the lives of the famous stalkers who never had anyone reach out to them and slap them with some reality.As someone with ADHD, I found the book a fairly easy read. Parents should know that the book is wrought with foul language and sexually suggestive narratives. As a minor, Caulfield smokes, drinks and attempts to procure the services of a prostitute, among other things... so this is not light reading nor should this be the reading material of a young person not mature enough to separate fact from fiction. Salinger\'s writing style is interesting - detailed, yet quickly paced, and a good piece of literature as reference for the aspiring writer.
