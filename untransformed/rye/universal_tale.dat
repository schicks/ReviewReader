I\'ve read The Catcher in the Rye many times--when I was 11, 13, 15, and 17 years old. Seriously. I loved it from the first time I read it, but it didn\'t hit home until I was a junior and senior in high school.  I AM  HOLDEN CAULFIELD. Well, not literally and exactly. But almost. Holden is an  extraordinary character. His absolute terror of leaving the wonderful,  innocent, carefree world of youth is something everyone can relate to. I\'m  about to graduate from high school, and even though I\'m excited to be a  free, independent adult, I can\'t help but be terrified of the corruption  and hard reality that lays ahead, which I have been blind to, as a young  person. I mean--who wouldn\'t miss being a kid?--living at home for free,  not having to do anything or be responsible for yourself or anyone. Holden  embodies this. To me, that\'s what I related to most from the book.  Most  kids I know don\'t like the book cuz they\'re forced to read it for class,  which is understandable. I wish they could see the beauty, and  heartbreaking universality of Holden\'s story, though. It is something J.D.  Salinger had the talent to grasp, and share it with the rest of the  world.And it\'s so freakin\' inspirational I have to go on Amazon.com and  tell some people!
