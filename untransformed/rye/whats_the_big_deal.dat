When you hear the name The Catcher In The Rye, you think of a lot of things.  First, a book you should have probably read in high school at some point.  Secondly, a classic by the nefarious recluse J.D Salinger.  Thirdly, a book that has been found on many a famous assassin or serial killer\'s bookshelf.  You buy The Cathcher In The Rye and some secret government agency puts your name on a list of possible homicidal maniacs or communist sympathizers or something.  Hmmmmmm.  Well.... I gotta tell ya, I never got around to reading Mr. Salinger\'s grand epic in high school, so I picked it up out of the sheer pleasure of reading another previously missed classic.  With mixed emotions, I began to read about the life and times of one Holden Caulfield.  Since it was originally published in 1945, 1946 &amp; 1951, I caught onto the controversy right away.  People just didn\'t write books with a lot of swearing in them at that time.  Holden calls everthing goddam.  Holden has been ejected from Pencey prep school for flunking out of all his subjects except for English.  He is a rebel.  He is perhaps some sort of deviant loner.  He\'s definitely got some depression issues.  Bottome line, Holden Caulfield is a weirdo.  End of story?  Not really.  Holden mystifies his readers with his inane analysis of everything from phony people to little girls to jock roomates and life itself.  Moving?  Stiring?  In places, maybe.  He doesn\'t snivel and he doesn\'t want us feeling sorry for him, but all the same, you can\'t help but being just a little annoyed with his semi-retarded antics.  He smokes like a chimney.  He drinks like a fish.  He sneaks into his parents house to talk to his little sister Phoebe, who seems like a smart, but perhap strange little girl.Overall...The Catcher In The Rye is a readable book.  Nothing spectacular.  I\'m sure the scholars would rebuke these statements, but I gotta tell ya, it wasn\'t anything special.  J.D. Salinger rambles on like a lunatic half the time and I\'m sure it was not all for the mere literary effects.  Ho hum in places, but still managing to keep the reader interested.  Sometimes you want to hang out with Holden and other times you want to smother him with a pillow.  It did not turn me into a serial killer...at least....I don\'t think it did.  One of the earliest books to use the phrase "F*** You" however, and I found that particularly flavorful.  The part where Holden describes his gravestone as his name, the dates, and someone\'s scrawl of "F*** You" at the bottom.  Clever.  If my name went on some secret government list for buying this book, I can\'t imagine what list I must have ended up on when I bought Vonnegut\'s Breakfast Of Champions or Barker\'s Books Of Blood or Orwell\'s Animal Farm, but they were far more worth the attention than Salinger\'s middle of the road biopic.Dig it!
