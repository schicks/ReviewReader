The Catcher in the Rye was a very bizarre read. I caught that the main idea was to convey the hardships experienced by most adolescent boys when coming of age, but I found nothing more significant than that. I kept searching for a more important lesson but all I found were complaints about "phonies" and eccentric anecdotes describing the tough life of a semi-rebellious teen. The writing style was choppy, erratic, and simple to convey that the ideas are coming from Holden\'s juvenile mind, but rather than entertain me, the style (and constant "goddams") annoyed me. The book is considered a classic, but I don\'t see any reason why it should be. It\'s a bizarre and simple story written in an obnoxious way with no underlying important theme other than the already obvious.
