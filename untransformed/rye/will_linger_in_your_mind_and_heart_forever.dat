I\'m so glad I finally got around to reading this fabulous book. It\'s a quick read yet characters and situations linger.  I\'ll never forget Holden Caulfield.He\'s brilliant with a partially educated mind.  He\'s naive yet recognizes perversion.  He has big ideas, the ideas of a man, yet he is still partially, a child.  He talks tough.  Hearing his empathy, caring and sensitivity and bewilderment  through that tough sounding language is both heartbreaking and endearing.Reading it seemed natural, personal and gripping.  Only after I completed reading the last page and went on about my day for a few hours did I realize I had just finished reading a masterpiece that would stay with me always.I recommend that you get on Netflix and see the documentary about J. D. Salinger.  It will enrich your experience whether you see it before or after you read the book.Joanna Poppink, MFTLos Angeles psychotherapistauthor: Healing Your Hungry Heart: recovering from your eating disorder
