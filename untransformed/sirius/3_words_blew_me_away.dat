This book is the best in the series and I can bet my life on the fact that it will remain that way until the end of these books. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is nothing short of brilliant, and I can\ufffdt explain the feeling you get when you are reading it. It is endlessly entertaining and amazingly original, you wonder where J.K. Rowling could ever get these ideas. It also brings up some new facts in the characters and some brand new magical creatures that I won\ufffdt give away just in case you haven\ufffdt read it. I doubt you haven\ufffdt read it, though, because basically the whole world is in love with these books and could finish them in a couple of days. The games of Quidditch are still fabulously entertaining. The characters are now pubescent which makes them able to feel new emotions \ufffd it keeps you awake at night wondering what will happen next. The finale is totally grand, mixing totally shocking ideas into magically nice descriptive language that truly brings to life a whole new revolution. I haven\ufffdt met one person who hasn\ufffdt claimed that this book is just great, flawless and spectacular. It seems everyone nowadays has good taste in books! Hooray for Harry Potter!
