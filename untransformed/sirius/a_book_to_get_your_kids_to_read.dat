I am the mother of three children as well as a teacher.  My 10 yr old son hated to read.  We started reading the first Harry Potter book when it came out and he was hooked.  We read a couple of chapters together whenever we  could.  We are still reading #2 2gether, but I read on ahead and let me  tell you, #3 is the BEST!  I have read it twice alone and can\'t wait to  get to it with my son.  These books have made a reader out of my son and we  enjoy reading them together.  The characters are wonderful and the action  is addicting.  All the students that I read these books with also love  Harry.  The Harry Potter series is a parent and teacher\'s dream!  We just  can\'t wait for #4.  My daughters\' are 4 and 7 and these books are still a  little over both of their heads.  But for kids 10 and up, Harry is a hit.
