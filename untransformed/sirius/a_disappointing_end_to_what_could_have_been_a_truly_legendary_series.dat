I\'m going to start this review by saying that I\'m an avid Harry Potter fan, worked THAT night in order to buy this book at midnight. I think Rowling is a good writer, but, I hate to say it, this book was a major disappointment to me. I expected much more considering where the six book left off, and the quality of the previous books. The first half of the book was excellent! It was well written and the descriptions were awesome. The only reason I think anyone would say the first half was slow was because they were so keen to get to the end! And then, halfway through, it dropped off. There was so much information that Rowling was throwing at the reader it was no longer descriptive.Instead of narrating an interesting story she was telling you frankly what happened. It was rushed and non-descript, certainly not well written and not at all what you would expect from the author of this series. The women were reduced to laundresses and sniffling cry-babies, a far cry from the strong female characters present in books 1-6. The men were reduced to bumbling nobodies who get by mostly on luck, not skill and crazy hairbrained schemes that were so much fun to read.***WARNING SPOILERS***Another issue with this book is that, following the tradition of being not descriptive enough, most of the second half\'s character deaths are almost painfully anti-climactic. One moment they\'re there, and then suddenly they\'re dead.It\'s terribly sad that characters like Lupin and Snape have less powerful deaths than Dobby and Hedwig.The fact that Snape had such a large roll in the sixth book is misleading, he has nearly no part in this book until the end, where he does nothing but dies. His story is never explored or explained, except for a single chapter full of memories which are, I have to say, the highlight of this book when it comes to writing, that and Dobby\'s death.***END SPOILERS***My one big question, amidst many plot holes and inconsistencies, which I\'ll leave others to describe (and I see they have), is how did a magical object reappear at the end of the novel when it is last seen at Gringott\'s?On a more positive note this book ties off all the loose ends, and would have been a fabulous ending to one of the most popular series of all time if only the author had put a bit more time and effort into writing the second half, instead of pleasing her fans with a deadline.I understand that some of my disappointment is probably because there is no way this book could live up to its hype, after seventeen years of writing I\'m sure Rowling was more than happy to put down her quill and move on from Harry Potter, but I think it\'s most unfortunate that the last book, which should have ended on a powerful and contented note, falls sadly short. The book\'s an alright read, but not what we\'ve come to expect in a "Harry Potter" book.All in all, 2 out of 5, and I WOULD NOT recommend this book for younger readers. Due to some disturbing scenes, and much (senseless without a reason or lesson to back them up) death, children under ten are probably not old enough to understand or fathom the violence.
