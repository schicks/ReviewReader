This work was a simply beautiful end to Ms. Rowling\'s extraordinary series.  What a pleasure it was to read a such a fine, wonderful series and to know that I may one day share it with my children--who will then hopefully share it with theirs and on and on.  What Ms. Rowling created is a work that deserves to endure, that deserves to be cherished by generation after generation.  Ms. Rowling should be heartily proud of the work to which she devoted so much of her life, so much of her time, and so much of her passion.  She has created something truly, truly special.I will not summarize the book\'s events in this review because everyone deserves to experience the pleasures of unraveling them one by one on his or her own.  What I do want to do is address the things that made this book--and the series as a whole--a work that stands out from the crowd.The thing I admire most about this series is Ms. Rowling\'s emphasis on love.  This book brought about the conclusion of that theme and created a shining of example of what can be accomplished through love.  Love transcends race and time, love transforms Rowling\'s world and makes it the beautiful place it is.  It is through one act of love after another that various characters are redeemed and made heroic.I was also very impressed with how Ms. Rowling handled the theme of morality.  Her world is shades of gray and that ambiguity gives her works a note of utmost authenticity.  In this book Harry learns that Dumbledore, his great mentor and father figure, was also a very human being who allowed pride and greed and ambition to lead to some very grave mistakes.  The Malfoys also learn an extremely painful lesson about the costs of one\'s actions and the moral choices one makes.  It is in the constant struggle to define what is moral and what is not that Harry grows and matures.  It is his discovery that even the best among us sometimes do things that we deeply regret that brings him to a greater understanding of human nature.I don\'t doubt that there will be many who disagree with me but I also liked how Ms. Rowling dealt with death in the series and in this book in particular.  The loss of beloved characters is very difficult but I think that Ms. Rowling uses those losses to make a clear statement that doing what is right often comes at a very dear cost.  I also really love the way she makes clear that every life is precious and it is this understanding of the precious nature of life that leads some characters to save those whom the less forgiving might write off as expendable.  It\'s easy to wish for vengeance and quite another thing to allow others the chance for redemption.In the end, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction for a series to which I have devoted a great deal of my life.  In many ways, I grew along with Harry and his friends and now that their story has come to a conclusion, I feel a great deal of gratitude and admiration toward Ms. Rowling.  I will never cease to be glad that she shared her vision with us, that she introduced us to the wonders of a new world, that she never let us forget that sometimes doing the right thing is infinitely more painful than doing what is easy, and that love can and will conquer all.  Thank you, Ms. Rowling, for sharing your gift with us and thank you for providing me with a series that I will treasure and that I will someday delight in sharing with my own child so that she too can experience the wonder of your creation.
