This is not a case of the book not living up to the hype. This is a case of a book being influenced by outside forces, namely J.K. Rowling\'s rushing publishers and, apparently, fans so intent on dissecting every line of her grand work and then hounding her on apparent inconsistencies that she broke into a full book devoted to desperately trying to wrap things up without upsetting too many people. The result is a book futilely rummaging through old hints from previous books inbetween genuine scenes of tension and imagination.Although many of my complaints are with specific decisions Ms. Rowling made during the book, I will refrain from enumerating how character X had almost no interaction with his/her love interest, the denial of any sort of confrontation with villain Y is intensely irritating, or stating that fifty pages attempting to portray all J.K.\'s characters in the same scene is ridiculous.What is most frustrating is that some parts, particularly scenes in the first half involving only two or three characters, are so slow and uninteresting that I was tempted to skip over them, were somehow important enough to warrant hundreds of pages to them. Other plotlines, however, particuarly involving Harry\'s paranemesis, Draco Malfoy, are glossed over with reckless abandon that made me believe I was reading a first draft.The Epilogue, if nothing else, is so self-indulgent that it really made me dislike many of the great things about this book. Make no mistake, dear readers, Rowling peaked with Goblet of Fire. In her final installment, she blunders through obstacles and plot holes. She drops very important storylines that could have made her legacy everlasting. But, most importantly, she violates golden rules of writing by affecting characters deeply with no care that it does not advance the story.Read this book. Absolutely. And then go back and look at what made the first six books so great. You\'ll really appreciate the little things now. Above all, remember what Ms. Rowling forgot: Harry Potter is an everyman character. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is where the magic happens.
