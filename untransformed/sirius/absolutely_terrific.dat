The third volume in J.K. Rowling\'s astoundingly successful Harry Potter series is an exciting and compelling read from page one.  Here again are all our favorite characters, both good -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore - and bad - Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy -- and a host of new ones to whet the reader\'s imagination.  There\'s a serial killer on the loose who seems to have escaped from prison with the intent of inflicting mortal harm on our illustrious hero.Rowling writes with gusto.  The plot barrels along with one twist and turn after another with a fair amount of humor to keep things from getting too dark, although of the first three novels, this is certainly the most frightening,the most violent, and perhaps the most poignant. The reader learns more about the events leading up to the death of Harry\'s parents and, as it turns out, the circumstances surrounding this defining event in our young hero\'s life are shrouded in mystery.  Rowling keeps you guessing until the climax.Aside from the plot, Rowling succeeds best in making Harry a  real, flesh-and-blood character confronted with questions and emotions that many of us face. Whether we\'re thirteen years old or thirty, there is something here for everyone to relate to, even the most jaded of readers.There\'s a bit of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in all of us.
