It is year number three at good ol\' Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and what a year it will be!  Thirteen-year-old Harry doesn\'t know what\'s in store for him ~~ and us lucky readers get to go along for the ride.Seems there is always an adventure awaiting the arrival of Harry at Hogwarts, and this year it is no exception.  The ruthless, much-feared prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius Black, has escaped and clues show he is heading straight for Harry.  Security is tight around Hogwarts since the Ministry of Magic has gotten word, and poor Harry has a horrible time while being sequestered at the dormitory for safety\'s sake.  Well, you didn\'t actually think he\'d stick around anyway, did you?  Not even for someone as frightening as Sirius Black, because now Harry knows a big secret and it doesn\'t seem right just to sit idly back.The third installment of Harry Potter\'s adventures is every bit as good as the previous two.  Plenty of action to satisfy even the pickiest of readers.  We get to learn a lot about Harry and his family this time around, plus Hermoine has a little secret of her own.  Excellent writing and imagination poured into the pages of this one.  J.K. Rowling has outdone herself once again, leaving fans with bated breath for the next in the series.  Harry Potter simply gets better with age.
