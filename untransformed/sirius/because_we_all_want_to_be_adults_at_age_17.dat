Well this was not the best effort for Ms. Rowling.  The book was full of aspects, ideas and concepts which did not stick to the true flavor or charter of the last 6 books.  I am not sure where Rowling\'s was going with this book.  She took out the whole aspect of adolescence and made the charters more like 40 year olds than 17 year olds.The story jumped all over the place with two missions going on at the same time.  The premise was really not in charter with the past books and it made it difficult to read as I kept on thinking "Get on with it will you!"The characters were also poorly developed.  Things just happened and you really did not see the steps leading up to all of it, rather the just appeared (excuse the pun) "like magic!"  Our three heroes were totally out of charter and hopefully the screen writers associated with the movie can make them more interesting, more plausible and more in character because the woman who contrived the whole series could not do this in her last book.The last 8 chapters are worth the read, so if you are going to pick up the book read the last 8 and you\'re all set because the first \xbe of the book really should have been for the 8th book, after graduation.Rowling wrote an epilogue which will make any reader of the series go "What?"  I really could not see the charters in the roles that they were placed in 19 years later.  The epilogue was forced and clich\xe9.  I really wonder if the publisher asked Rowling to do this because it is so unlike her.  I remember reading an interview about her writing this last section in her hotel room while she cried and drank.  No wonder why she cried and drank, this epilogue was terrible, I would cry too. I would have much preferred to see closure at Hogwarts rather than this epilogue. We needed to see Harry, Ron and Hermione with their friends, family and faculty and see them finally enjoy the spoils of victory but rather we got an ending (I am not talking about the epilogue but the last chapter) which rivaled the final episode of the television show Cheers.It\'s too bad Rowling made the charters become adults instead of who they actually were;  It would have been interesting to see the last year at Hogwarts and witness the three main charters coming of age, defeating evil, and enjoying the age, however, Rowling would not let this happen.  Rather she made them as old as she is and we see the charters at this age and rather than at an age, for most of us, is quite magical.
