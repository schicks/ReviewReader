J.K. Rowling has done it again!  I\'m 15, and I just love the Harry Potter books.  (I\'m must say that Fred and George Weasley are two of my favorite characters)  I don\'t think that there\'s anything evil with these books.  Some people don\'t like them because there\'s witchcraft.  There\'s no serious  magic done in these books.  The "witchcraft" almost isn\'t  witchcraft.  It\'s like Star Wars with the good side and the bad side of the  Force.  Harry Potter is on the good side of wizardry, whereas Voldemort has  gone bad.  I don\'t hear anyone trying to ban Star Wars, and I don\'t want  anyone to try to ban Harry Potter from the schools.  I highly recommend  these books to everyone!
