Warning...don\'t read the article "Not for Muggles" in the Dec 16, 1999 issue of New York Review of Books...it gives away a CRITICAL secret bound up in the plot of The Prisoner of Azkaban. I truly loved this  3rd Harry Potter book and thought it astounding, as good as or better than  the first two volumes. But knowing a key element of the outcome knocked out  some of the punch. The New York Review might be for thinking people, but in  this case it sure seemed dumb.
