As Harry gets older, the maturity-level of the books seems to age as well! But only by a year at a time. Harry\'s challenges and decissions have become more complex as he has. Every book is satisfying. One problem I\'d suggest  the author address: Harry always gets such wonderfull Christmas and  birthday presents, and yet he never seems to give any in return! What\'s up?  He IS very wealthy isn\'t he? He cares about his friends, right? Well, after  three great years of Weasly jumpers, chocolate frogs, and one very  thoughtfull broom-care kit from Hermione...I don\'t understand why such a  boy isn\'t giving back.
