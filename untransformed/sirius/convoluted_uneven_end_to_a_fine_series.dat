I am not the first to claim that the Harry potter series began to degrade when 1) the movies began to arrive and 2) Rowling became so successful that editors will no longer touch her work. This clearly has affected her writing, most especially with Book 6 (Half-Blood Prince) and now the final installment.Unlike the magical stand-alone stories of the previous four books, Book 7 is completely dependent on having read previous books. Gone is the wonder of the magical world; it is all about You-Know-Who having taken over authority (in the background, without any real fight by the wizarding community) and Harry\'s quest to destroy the Horcruxes--a strange sort of quest, seeing Voldemort doesn\'t realize for awhile they\'re being destroyed, and their individual loss does not seem to affect him in the least. The "Deathly Hallows" of the book, three magical objects that apparently all link together to master Death, ultimately don\'t have a real bearing on the final outcome. In the end, it is all about Harry sacrificing himself; something that could have been done without Horcruxes or Hallows or Red Herrings, as they ultimately prove to be.There is a lack of real emotion in this book. Characters come and go (and die) without a real sense of loss. It feels arbitrary and, in the case of Wormtongue, completely manipulated by the author. The only character who seems to rise above the moment is Neville, but otherwise there is little sense of release or closure or excitment seeing these familiar characters in perilous experiences.I recommend the book only to see how the series finishes up, but buy it used or check it out from the library. I was hoping for a grand finish, and instead I got a first or second draft when a good polish (and a real rethinking of the plot) could have made it extraordinary.
