Do you believe in magic?  Do you really believe?Anyone questioning that magic exists need only look to HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS to eradicate any doubt on that score.It wasn\'t until the fourth book in the series, HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, that I began to grasp the huge scope of J. K. Rowling\'s intent.  That moment of understanding was thrilling.  No small part of the suspense of the ensuing years has been the prevailing question: can she pull this off?  Now we know: yes, she can.  At every step of the way, throughout the remainder of the series, every promise implicit back then has been fulfilled to virtually universal acclaim.  There\'s magic in that.  Just ask Lemony Snicket.I was traveling on the Sunday following the book release.  All through the airport, everywhere I looked, there were passengers with the big, orange book in tow.  This was paradoxically both a solitary and a vast shared experience, 8.3 million of us throughout the country reading the same book on the same weekend.  Magic.There has to be some powerful charm at work here.  How else to explain the extraordinary imagination and descriptive powers of Ms. Rowling who, an ocean away, plants such vivid pictures in my head?  (...).I love that sensation of being so completely immersed in a book that one moment I\'m on page 30, the next on page 70, and when I finally come to I don\'t even have a recollection of turning the pages.  Such is the experience of reading HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.  Ms. Rowling steals time and controls completely what we see, hear, and feel.  This is virtual reality without the pesky machines.  Small wonder she chose to write about the world of wizardry.  She\'s something of an expert in the field.And finally, a popular children\'s book about death?  That\'s a pretty neat trick.  Death is in the title.  Two quotes about death preface the book. Death lurks on every page.  Yet in the end, the book isn\'t about death.  It\'s about mastering death.  We master death by embracing the fact of death, by living a life without fear of death, and by realizing that there are indeed parts of us that transcend death and live on in our friends and loved ones.  Of course, for that last part to work you have to live a loving life.  And if that is what Ms. Rowling teaches our children and our children\'s children, teaches any of us who are willing to learn, then that may be the greatest and most profound magic of all.
