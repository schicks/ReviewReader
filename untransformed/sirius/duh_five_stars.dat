I know there is already over a thousand reviews but I just hadto say something.  Harry is back in Hogwarts for his third year andnow there is an escaped prisoner searching for him!  Sirius Black killed 13 people with a single curse and now he is after Harry.  BUT Harry\'s trouble doesn\'t end there.  Hermione has recently bought an ugly cat called Crookshanks who is after Ron\'s pet rat Scabbers.  As Crookshanks continues to chase Scabbers, their friendship is wearing thin. AND that\'s not all.  Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher, is totally convinced that Harry\'s life will end very, very soon. I have read this book over 30 times (It\'s probably more than that but I\'m not sure how many times it really is) and I still find it to be a new and intriguing story every time I pick it up, unlike most books that are spoiled once you read them once.  If I could, I would rate this book five gabazillion stars.  J.K., if you read this, I give you TWO THUMBS UP!
