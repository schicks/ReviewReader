This is a fantastic story for literally any age!  Be sure to read the books in order, as the author truly uses detail to enhance the magic of the tale.  Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and  wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Hogwarts - Harry\'s  wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a  courageous young boy.  At the age of 11, Harry Potter had to step up to his  place of honor and danger in a world he never knew existed.  In his 2nd  year at Hogwarts, Harry was back in the thick of adventure while he dealt  with a new Dark Arts teacher as well as a few old nemeses from book 1.  Potter not only showed a bit more of his own courage and ability while at  the same time fighting a few of his own fears.  This tense theme continued  into the 3rd book, where Harry has much more to contend with than his own  past.  You will be amazed at the villains and heroes in this one - the  twists and turns had me reading from cover to cover more than once!  The  climax has a gripping level of suspense so you CAN\'T put it down!  And,  once more, wise old Dumbeldor shows what it really means to be a wizard and  a hero as he helps Harry understand a bit more of himself!  (Please,  Rowling, don\'t ever lose this!  His wisdom makes us all think a bit more  about ourselves too!)  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thought out  story as well as a good time.  Yes, it is a book targeted for children, but  as an adult I can even say that I sat, after reading it, just thinking.  My  mind couldn\'t seem to pull itself out of the captivating world of  Rowling\'s, and I had that warm feeling that you get when the good guys win  over the bad ones, and you know the world is safe until the next adventure.  I can\'t help it.  I like Star Wars and other wide epics that tell a good  myth.  Although I didn\'t start reading fantasy until after I went to  college, I have become a huge fan over the years.  Rowling creates a tight,  quick paced story that keeps you reading \'till the end, much like Tolkien  and Lewis (2 great authors)!  She has really added a worthwhile series to a  sometimes forgotten genera.  I find myself caught up in the characters and  story.  My only dislike for the Harry Potter series is that it is slated to  last only 7 books!
