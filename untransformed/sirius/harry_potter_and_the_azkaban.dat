The third book in the HARRY POTTER series is the best yet, with much information about Harry\'s father, James Potter.In case you\'ve been petrified in the hospitial wing with Madam Pomfry as your nurse, I\'ll  explain that it all started with the landmark classic HARRY POTTER AND THE  SORCERER\'S STONE, followed by HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and  now HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.  In each novel, we learn more  about Harry Potter\'s parents (whom were murdered by Voldmeort, the greatest  Dark Wizard of modern times), as we and Harry come closer to finding out  why he escaped that night, as well as why Voldemort wanted to rid the world  of the Potters at all.Now, in the third book, Sirius Black, heir to  Voldemort, has escaped from the wizard prison--AZKABAN--and set out to  avenge his ruined master.  And Harry isn\'t safe, not even within Hogwarts  (his magical school), because of a secret that\'s been kept from the world  for tweleve long years....
