I know many people won\'t like this review, so I prepare myself at the outset for a barrage of unhelpful votes.  I am not planning any major spoilers, but be warned: this review is mainly meant for the consumption of people who\'ve read the book.  After all, how many people out there are really planning to base their decision to read this on the opinion of a few internet reviewers?This book provides pretty much everything we\'ve been promised from the outset: an ending, and a satisfying one at that -- but not without its price.  Many die, not just the two Rowling mentioned in so many interviews.  Many beloved characters die, and some of them die "off screen" as it were, so that we as readers aren\'t even privy to the details of their deaths, or their final moments of life.  Some of these deaths will bring tears to the eyes of any loyal Potter devotee, I\'ve no doubt of that.  But as for the main death, the one so many have wondered about?  Well, that\'s where Rowling falls back on a few too-worn literary devices, and where she loses one of her stars.I found this book to be far too full of easy short cuts and simplistic cliches to give it five stars.  Far too many times, Harry and his friends were "mysteriously" saved at the last minute.  And the real answers to these so-called mysteries will fall much more easily into the hands of die-hard Potter fanatics who\'ve spent hours studying the books and pouring over the fan sites than they ever do into the hands of the characters themselves.  This is too often frustrating.  Perhaps it\'s unfair to criticize or punish Rowling for the perseverance and intelligence of her fans, but the fact is that many of her secrets have been guessed.  In fact, the few that haven\'t seem only to surprise because Rowling conveniently has them pop up for the first time in this book.  Magical objects we\'ve seen many times before suddenly have new and useful -- and VERY convenient -- magical properties.  People we\'ve only heard of have convenient new information and relevance to the plot.She lost the other star because of omissions.  Unexplained (and again, very convenient) plot twists, otherwise known as plot holes, are all over the book.  A book this long that purports to be the end of an epic series should not have this many plot holes and inexplicable events.  (None of which I can go into detail about without giving up major spoilers -- sorry.)  And most damning of all, when some of the plot holes are explained, it\'s done in a manner resembling what the brilliant movie "The Incredibles" referred to as "monologuing" -- when one character (usually the bad guy) sits around explaining the whole plot and nothing bad happens to the good guys while all these loose ends are conveniently tied up.  For some reason, the villain, no matter how vicious he has been throughout the story, always conveniently waits to attack until the hero\'s had plenty of time to get all the answers he needs to defeat the bad guy.  The only change Rowling makes to this shopworn device is that she does it via magical means.  (Though in her case, the magical mean in question is the Pensieve -- something shopworn in and of itself, considering the number of times it\'s now been used in this series to convey crucial information.)  I was also sorely disappointed to realize that she left out a number of things she practically promised fans would be included in this book.  For instance, many fans have asked her what Harry\'s parents did for a living.  She always said she couldn\'t tell us because it would be too big a plot spoiler for the upcoming novels.  Well, now the novels are all finished and we still don\'t know.  Why didn\'t she include that in this final book, if it really was supposed to matter so much?  And why did she leave so much crucial information out of her far too short epilogue?There is no doubt that in Harry Potter Rowling has created a brave and endurable hero, one who will linger in the hearts and minds of readers for generations to come.  But in this humble reader\'s opinion, she has also created one for whom the struggle ended a bit too quickly and easily, of whom too many things are left unknown, and for whom answers and help came too readily and too conveniently in the end.Then again . . . maybe I just wanted it to last a little longer.  Because it\'s over now, and nothing like Harry Potter is ever happening to this humble reader again.
