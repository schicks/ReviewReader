We love Harry Potter, not just this last book, but all of the books.  We can\'t wait for the next installment.  We have bought these books as hardcover, softcover (when available) and on audio.  Sam (10 years old) has read them from cover to cover and listens to the tapes nightly.  Jill (mom  of Sam) has read all the books and loves them too.  These books are great  because they keep your attention - in fact it was hard for either of us to  put them down and do things that we were supposed to do.  We think that  almost everyone will love Harry, his friends and their adventures! J.K.  Rowling - Keep them books coming - we love them!
