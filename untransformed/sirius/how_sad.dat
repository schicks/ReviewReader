I\'ve been a die-hard Harry Potter fan for years now, still am, and the anticipation of this final book was unlike anything I had ever witnessed. I was over the moon with excitement. Pottermania was more than just colorful costumes, or wand-waving, or playing quidditch in your backyard. The story had an elemental substance, a cross-cultural testament to true living. The magic was greater than the sum of its parts. How can something like that not end on a high note? The Deathly Hallows, the last act of one of the most celebrated sagas of our generation, concludes not as the triumph it could have been but as an embarrassing, hollow groan. JK Rowling was either incapable or unwilling to deliver an HP novel worthy of her prior standards.Unforgivable Plot Holes.Most fantasy stories have plot holes to a degree, and the previous Potter books are no exception. It all comes down to whether or not the story allows for a reasonable suspension of belief within the context of the created world. The disparities in Deathly Hallows range from forgivable to lazy to incompetent, and it shows a monumental lack of care when your easiest-to-fix plot problems somehow survive all manuscript revisions. It\'s a screw-you to devoted readers.The top 3 offenses: (1) Wand lore and the Elder Wand. It\'s unbeatable unless it\'s not (see Dumbledore v Grindelwald) or it\'s unbeatable unless its allegiance has been transferred to another wand (Seriously?). (2) The name taboo. So the ministry can track anyone anywhere in seconds if they say a certain word? Why not put taboos on a whole host of words? This one isn\'t even worth trying to explain away. It was a cheap plot trick in order to get Harry captured at just the right moment. (3) Harry\'s blood protection. According to Dumbledore at Kings Cross, Harry will not be harmed as long as Voldemort lives because of the blood infusion thing from back in book 4. Essentially, there\'s no risk to Harry in the final battle. No risk = No dramatic tension. And that\'s not even the end of it. By simply being present at the finale, Harry shields his friends from harm too.Runner-up offenses: The slipshod introduction of the Hallows, the sorting hat as a replicator of Gryffindor Swords, JKR\'s convenient 180 on what happens when a secret keeper dies, Hermione summoning Horcruxes for Dummies out of the headmaster\'s office, why Dumbledore never mentioned the lost diadem to Harry, why nobody ever noticed Snape\'s patronus, how house elves can be summoned instantaneously to and from any location regardless of magical protections, and coincidental close calls everywhere--breaking into the ministry, breaking into Gringotts, locating horcruxes, escaping from the Malfoy Manor--ALL are successful because of timely dumb luck.Character Inconsistencies.You can pair this one with plot because radical changes in character were likely needed to smooth over the worst of the story problems. For example, there\'s no believable reason for why Voldemort would open his mind up to Harry again after he intentionally closed it in the last book. But if he didn\'t, then Harry wouldn\'t have received the vital information he needed to advance. Also, Voldemort\'s IQ seems to have taken a nose dive since we last saw him in book 5. It\'s a good thing though because Harry and team wouldn\'t have had a chance in hell otherwise (see above, re: luck). By the end it was like Voldemort had wandered over into a Scooby-Doo cartoon. "Gaaahhhhh! I would\'ve gotten away with it too, if it weren\'t for you kids!"And then there\'s Harry casting unforgivable curses. This isn\'t the same Harry as from book 5 when he attempts the Cruciatus Curse in a fit of rage against Bellatrix after she murders his godfather. There he was like a child mishandling his dad\'s rifle. This time around Harry shows no trepidation. He finds them convenient to get what he needs--no, no, no! That\'s what the bad guys do!Other inconsistencies: Dumbledore has a sordid past, but that\'s not as disconcerting as the present-day Dumbledore being revealed as a manipulative jerk. Snape drops a few IQ points by never putting 2 and 2 together regarding Voldemort\'s horcruxes. Harry and Ginny--are they even an item? Hermione seems less assertive which is characteristically backwards for her. Ron turns out okay though. Heck he might even be the only main character to show consistent, believable growth.Hogwarts. Or lack thereof.Plot and character account for the majority of problems in DH, and had they been fixed, I think the the whole thing might have been adequate. Nevertheless, JKR took a risk by not having Harry, Ron and Hermione attend their 7th year at Hogwarts. It was never really a choice given the narrative starting point of DH, and it\'s difficult to imagine the trio hunting horcruxes while being hunted by V and the ministry all while studying for their NEWTs. I think book 6 and maybe book 5 would have played out differently had this alternate universe occurred. In hindsight, removing Hogwarts as the central setting of DH gutted the story of its essential awe and heart. The school is as much a character in HP as are its inhabitants.---This is my third reading of Deathly Hallows. I read it once when it came out in 2007, once soon after in order to process the train wreck I had just read, and once more this year, seven years on. My hope was that time would allow me to give an honest review of a convoluted book so blindly adored by the world, and it has. DH is even worse than I remember. I love the world of Harry Potter and this final installment is an insult to thinking fans everywhere who respect the whole as more than mere stories for children.
