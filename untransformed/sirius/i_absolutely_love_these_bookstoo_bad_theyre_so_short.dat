I don\'t normally read "children\'s books," but I have always had a soft spot for fantasy, my favorite genre (particularly books involving magic and talking mice, for some reason).  I had never intended to ready  any of the Harry Potter books, but my mother, acting on a whim, bought the  first two volumes for me, saying that they were very popular.  The books  sat unread in my room for weeks, until late one Wednesday night, when I  read both books, finishing at 3 AM, and neglecting to translate my Cicero  assignment.  The books were great!  I immediately bought the 3rd  installment, which I read immediately that afternoon.  I find it easy to  identify with Harry Potter, who reminds me of myself sometimes.  Particularly, I enjoy references to Latin in the books (such as the first  example, caput draconis, head of Draco, in book 1.)  The twisted plot at  the end of Prisoner of Azkaban intrigued me, compelling me to read the last  few chapters multiple times to fully grasp all of it winding lines.  The  Prisoner of Azkaban took a step away from what I view as the first and  second books\' major fallacy: the repetitive plot line.  Potter has a bad  time with his family, goes to school, has trouble with a permutation of  Voldemort, defeats Voldemort, and gets congratulated by everbody, helping  his house win the Cup.  Blah Blah Blah. The third book remediated this  problem, since it wasn\'t clear who the villan was until the very end.  My  larges gripe with the Harry Potter books is now length.  I read the books  in a little over two hours each.  Its rather torturous to wait for weeks on  end for two hours of enjoyment.  I wish the Harry Potter books could be  more like the books of Ayn Rand in that area: enjoyable and interesting,  but abysmally long.  (My average reading time for Atlas Shrugged is  surpassed only by War and Peace...snore...snore...)  To end on a positive  note, I am happy to award my five stars to "Harry Potter and the  Prisoner of Azkaban" in appreciation to Rowlings\' correction of some  of the problems with the first books and my opinion that the Harry Potter  books are VERY ENJOYABLE!  I dread what will happen after the seventh book,  when Harry has graduated from school.  Will he be a professor, or set out  on his own?  Or Rowling just (sob! sob! sob!) terminate the series?  I  fervently hope the books will never be lost to that extreme!  (If you have  read my whole spiel, I thank you very much for hearing me out and not  averting your gaze in disgust, boredom, outright anger or whatever else my  review might drive you to.
