After reading the other review of this audiobook, I am taking the plunge...with a sideways nod towards H.L. Mencken\'s warning: "The first sign of insanity is writing a letter to the editor!"I simply want to tell you this- Jim Dale\'s reading of the Harry Potter series  is OVER THE TOP!!!Having been an aficionado of spoken word poetry and literature, I am  astonished by his virtuosity of voice characterization and nuance.The book itself... hmmm....it\'s pretty good!Jim Dale?It should indicate on the recording cover:"As read by Jim Dale M.B.E.!"
