In anticipation of Harry Potter, Book 4, I had to read the first three books again.  What I was struck with, again, is the sheer imaginative nature of J.K. Rowling\'s books.  Simply put, these books are instant  classics."Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the  third in the series following Harry Potter at Hogwart\'s school of wizardry.  Harry is now a 13-year old (his birthday occurring at the beginning of the  book), and concerned mostly with classes, Quidditch (a wizard sport), and  the fact that he\'s not allowed to visit the local wizard village of  Hogsmeade with his friends on the weekends.  One of the reasons for this is  that Sirius Black, a convicted murderer, has broken out of Azkaban, the  wizard prison, and word has it that he\'s out to get Harry.In keeping  with Harry Potter tradition, the reader can expect surprises, twists and  turns, malicious rivals, uncommonly kind professors, terrible relatives,  amazing magic candy, true friendships, and a whiz-bang ending.It\'s  delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel of the previous  books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature.  This book is a little  longer than the previous books, but the imagination never lets up, and  gradually Harry\'s world is widening.I would recommend this book to  ANYONE (any age) who enjoys the writings of Roald Dahl, C.S. Lewis,  Madeleine L\'Engle, or J.R.R. Tolkien.  This is a very fun, humourous, and  enjoyable fantasy novel, and one that should be read more than once!
