The night I turned the last page of the Harry Potter series, it was close to midnight. I gently laid the book beside my bed, and for most of the night I could only stare at the dark ceiling and replay in my mind the scenes from the story.  Like that silly old country song goes, I was a "Harry Potter Fan" before being one was cool.  When the first two books in the series came to America I was working as a librarian and had a heads up on it before the public.  I was also the test subject for the library whom they got to read the book to find out if it was worth all the hipe.  I can easily remember falling in love with the characters and vivid scenery from the beginning.  Now it\'s over.  The story has come to an end.  I think I cried through most of this book knowing it was over.  Watching many of my beloved characters loosing their life the war against Voldimort, and some very unexpected characters find the strength to stand up and fight.  I know we still have the movies, still in the making, but they are just not the same.  Yesterday, my family and I were at a restaurant when I overheard the next table talking about the lastest Harry Potter movie and I sighed.  If they only knew what they were missing by not reading the book. Will there ever be another book to take his place?  I don\'t mean a carbon copy, but a book that touched us as much?  One that caused a nation, a world, to sit down and pick up a book?  And Will it come again in my lifetime?Goodbye old friend.
