First of all, don\'t expect Tolkien or Lewis.  You won\'t find such literary depth and deftness here.  J.K. Rowling\'s Harry Potter books are much more akin to Roald Dahl\'s quirky, alternately lighthearted and dark children\'s  stories.  However, that\'s not to say Rowling\'s books aren\'t well-written,  enormously entertaining and fun.  They are.  In fact, I can honestly say  that very few books of late have delighted me as much -- *especially* the  CD versions.  For as much as I enjoy *reading* the Harry Potter books (and  I have them all in print form), I love *hearing* them even more.  Jim  Dale\'s readings (especially the briskly-paced and richly charactered third  book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) have to be heard to be  believed.  Dale is a master storyteller.  He switches between characters  seamlessly, giving each one a different voice and personality.  His English  accent is a delight, and the pronounciations are crisp.  I especially enjoy  hearing the voices of Draco Malfoy, Hagrid and Professors Dumbledore, Snape  and McGonagall (who has a delightful brogue).  I recently purchased the  third book on CD in anticipation of my 3-hour drive (each way!) to Chicago  for a conference.  I loaded up my car\'s CD changer and listened all the way  down and back, hanging on every word.  Dale\'s fabulous reading turned what  could have been a long, uneventful trip into a delightful escape to  Hogwarts.  In fact, when I returned home, I didn\'t want to get out of my  car ... and, I\'m nearly ashamed to say, kept looking for excuses to run  errands just so I could continue listening to the exciting story unfold!  Rowling\'s books seem tailor-made for *hearing*, as if she wrote them  specifically to be read aloud.  So if you\'ve ever wanted to try an audio  book, and if you enjoy reading the Harry Potter series, I highly recommend  Jim Dale\'s presentations.  Thankfully, the audio versions are UNABRIDGED so  you can enjoy every single word.  I hope Dale continues to be the reader  for the Harry Potter series.  I can\'t imagine any other voice for them.  He\'s a perfect match for Rowling\'s words.  By the way, I\'m 39 years old.  And I was raised on science fiction and fantasy books.  I rank the Harry  Potter books right up there with some of my all-time favorites.  As I said  in the beginning, Rowling\'s books are not as deep or clever as many of the  classics of the genre, but they\'re every bit as entertaining in their own  right.  I recommend the books, but I *highly* recommend Jim Dale\'s reading  of them.  Especially Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
