12Here\'s the perspective from a parent educator who is also a mother of four: Proper_Noun read all three Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books to my older children (ages 8, 10, 12) and I think that Proper_Noun a worthy Proper_Noun He\'s an everyday kid - a bit unsure of himself, he makes mistakes, but he also makes good decisions. He has friends, but there are also kids who don\'t like him. He\'s average looking, a bit clumsy and wears glasses. He has courage, but he also gets scared. This ordinary kid gets to have extraordinary adventures. And even after goof-ups and enemies along the way - he always ends up successful in reaching his main goals - which are always for the greater good. These books are also packed with creative imagination that kids love: life-sized chess pieces that move themselves, invisibility cloaks, magic pets, secret passageways with mysterious passwords. Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books have enough mystery, intrigue and adventure to keep my 8-year-old ball-of-energy enthralled enough to sit still no matter how long I read - and always begging for more. Yet the books are fascinating to my 12-year-old bookworm who re-reads them numerous times.
