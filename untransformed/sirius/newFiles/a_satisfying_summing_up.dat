6Here\'s a spoiler-free review (save for the broad outline):Far more than any previous book in the series, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun is not for those who haven\'t read the preceding books. Indeed, I was happy I had resisted the urge to jump in before finishing my re-reading of the previous six books. For the devoted fan, though, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wraps up the series quite well: masks are removed and accounts are settled.Whereas each of the previous six books, especially the first four, had their own mini-arc that was satisfying in itself, the pleasure in Proper_Noun Proper_Noun comes from seeing Rowling weave together the threads of the backstory to bring the tapestry of the entire series into focus.Having read a fair bit of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun class="a-link-normal" href="/The-Hero-with-a-Thousand-Faces-Mythos-Books/dp/0691017840">The Proper_Noun with a Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun well as plenty of fairy stories, legends, and mythology--I felt confident that I knew the broad outlines of the conclusion to the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun story; and I had guessed the identity of the mysterious Proper_Noun and sussed out which team Proper_Noun was playing on. My guesses were correct, but that didn\'t spoil the pleasure of learning the details. Nor did it keep me from being surprised occasionally, e.g. by Proper_Noun some ways, I found the story of the Proper_Noun hallows" a bit of a distraction. On the other hand, the presence of a yoni/lingam symbol on the jacket of a children\'s book Proper_Noun least in the Proper_Noun edition) was amusing and got me looking more deeply at the other symbols in the story. Indeed, this was the first book in the series that I felt was solidly more mythical than muggle.As expected, people (and other creatures) die. I don\'t fault Rowling for that, but I often felt that their deaths were "wasted"--that they were killed off with little meaning or chance to mourn. I was also disappointed that some characters who played a large role in earlier books were almost unheard from here, though to be fair we do a satisfying bit about other characters. I was pleased, though, that by the end of the story all of the characters were more human (even the ones who weren\'t, strictly speaking, human).The final chapter was a shock at first, in that its tone was so different from the rest of the book. (I was reminded of the final chapter of\xa0<a class="a-link-normal" href="/A-Clockwork-Orange/dp/0393312836">A Proper_Noun Proper_Noun one that was left out of the Proper_Noun edition.) But as I lived with the story for a couple of post-Potter days, I realized that it was perfectly appropriate. The Proper_Noun Proper_Noun story has, at times, been delightfully subversive--even Proper_Noun But, for the most part, the virtues of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are bourgeois ones, and the boon he wins is an appropriate one.Thank you, Proper_Noun Rowling, for an immensely enjoyable seven books!
