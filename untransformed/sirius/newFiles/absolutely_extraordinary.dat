13I waited like everyone else, for the final Proper_Noun Proper_Noun story, and like everyone else, I had theories and thoughts on what I thought might happen. I paid no attention to any so called spoilers, I felt that would ruin the very experience of the story. I was at the bookstore before midnight, like most people. I waited Proper_Noun line, and then something that irked me happen. A girl no more than 12, had gotten her book, and went to the little coffee shop, read the ending of the book, and as I passed by, still Proper_Noun line, she exclaimed, "I wish I hadn\'t read that." I realized what she had done, and hoped she blurted nothing out. She did not, and left. I made it all the way through the novel without anyone telling me the ending, so I will not spoil it for anyone else, because this novel is so complex, that if you skip to the ending, you truly miss out.It is an extraordinary novel. Rowling\'s prose is at its best Proper_Noun this novel. I was thrilled throughout. The story contains some of the most action oriented sequences of any of the series, thereby making it truly the most exciting. There are brilliant schemes, and near miss escapes, moments that will make you laugh out loud, and moments that will make you literally weep. She answers most of readers questions brilliantly Proper_Noun this novel, and they come littered throughout the novel, so if you skip around, your going to miss something important.Overall, this was a brilliant conclusion, to one of the most magical epic tales told Proper_Noun modern history, it is no wonder that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has cast a spell on the world. I was satisfied with her ending to the epic tale, and the explanations that came with it. I will not reveal it here. To reveal the secrets is to cast dark magic, and I could never do that. Read it, enjoy it, and remember, that no matter what happens Proper_Noun the end, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun will live on forever! Also, Proper_Noun my opinion, this is by far, the best novel Proper_Noun the series.
