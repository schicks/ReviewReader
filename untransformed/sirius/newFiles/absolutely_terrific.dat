14The third volume in Proper_Noun Rowling\'s astoundingly successful Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series is an exciting and compelling read from page one. Here again are all our favorite characters, both good -- Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun - and bad - Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun -- and a host of new ones to whet the reader\'s imagination. There\'s a serial killer on the loose who seems to have escaped from prison with the intent of inflicting mortal harm on our illustrious hero.Rowling writes with gusto. The plot barrels along with one twist and turn after another with a fair amount of humor to keep things from getting too dark, although of the first three novels, this is certainly the most frightening,the most violent, and perhaps the most poignant. The reader learns more about the events leading up to the death of Proper_Noun parents and, as it turns out, the circumstances surrounding this defining event in our young hero\'s life are shrouded in mystery. Proper_Noun keeps you guessing until the climax.Aside from the plot, Proper_Noun succeeds best in making Proper_Noun a real, flesh-and-blood character confronted with questions and emotions that many of us face. Whether we\'re thirteen years old or thirty, there is something here for everyone to relate to, even the most jaded of readers.There\'s a bit of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun in all of us.
