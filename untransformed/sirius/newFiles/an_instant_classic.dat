7The third Proper_Noun Proper_Noun book does not disappoint. It seems that Proper_Noun Rowling just gets better with practice. As an adult, I felt that this book (and the whole series) was very imaginative and witty. I fell in love with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun all over again and I can\'t wait for the 4th-7th books to be written.It is just rare that a book (let alone a series) can capture the imagination of several generations and be thoroughly enjoyed by all who read it. These books are instant classics that I can\'t wait to share with my children when I have them!
