7The best thing to me about the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books is the heart. The fantastic and magical world, the wizardry and the colorful characters and the exciting and mysterious plots are all amazingly written, but the love Proper_Noun has for his parents and their love for him, the love and bravery between the three best friends Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun who would die for each other makes this a most magical series of books. The writing does get better and more mature as Proper_Noun gets older and Proper_Noun Rowling is very skillful and subtle at accomplishing this. Proper_Noun has already become a very memorable character in storytelling history. I can\'t wait to read the fourth book and feel sad that Proper_Noun Rowling has decided to stop at seven - I hope she changes her mind and we can follow Proper_Noun into adulthood!
