215In anticipation of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun 4, I had to read the first three books again. What I was struck with, again, is the sheer imaginative nature of Proper_Noun Rowling\'s books. Simply put, these books are instant classics."Harry Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is the third in the series following Proper_Noun Proper_Noun at Proper_Noun school of wizardry. Proper_Noun is now a 13-year old (his birthday occurring at the beginning of the book), and concerned mostly with classes, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun wizard sport), and the fact that he\'s not allowed to visit the local wizard village of Proper_Noun with his friends on the weekends. One of the reasons for this is that Proper_Noun Proper_Noun a convicted murderer, has broken out of Proper_Noun the wizard prison, and word has it that he\'s out to get Proper_Noun keeping with Proper_Noun Proper_Noun tradition, the reader can expect surprises, twists and turns, malicious rivals, uncommonly kind professors, terrible relatives, amazing magic candy, true friendships, and a whiz-bang ending.It\'s delightful to see how Proper_Noun can stay true to the feel of the previous books, and yet allow Proper_Noun and friends to mature. This Proper_Noun is a little longer than the previous books, but the imagination never lets up, and gradually Proper_Noun world is widening.I would recommend this Proper_Noun to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun age) who enjoys the writings of Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Lewis, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun or Proper_Noun Tolkien. This is a very fun, humourous, and enjoyable fantasy novel, and one that should be read more than once!
