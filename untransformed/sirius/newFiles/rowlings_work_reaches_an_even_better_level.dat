53_Harry Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is a wonderful addition Proper_Noun series. It is the third Proper_Noun in the series, which should be read Proper_Noun order.* It\'s the best way to understand and to fully enjoy the series. Proper_Noun 3 is somewhat more complex and more mature than Proper_Noun 1 and Proper_Noun 2. I enjoyed Proper_Noun 1 and 2; Proper_Noun 3 made me a true Proper_Noun Proper_Noun devotee. I think its plot has considerably more emotional weight. It\'s not just a pleasantly exciting story; it deals with issues of trust and friendship that make you feel and think as you read.The basic premise of the Proper_Noun is simple: Proper_Noun Proper_Noun has escaped from the wizard prison, Proper_Noun and is on the loose, looking for Proper_Noun Adventures ensue. A wonderful character (perhaps my favorite in the series to date), Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun joins the Proper_Noun cast. The Proper_Noun contains fascinating revelations about Proper_Noun family and draws on small clues offered in the earlier books.As an evangelical Proper_Noun and an avid reader of fantasy, Proper_Noun aware that certain other Christians have condemmed the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series as supporting the occult. That\'s pure rubbish. I would suggest that parents of very young Proper_Noun fans be careful to supervise the reading of Proper_Noun 3 by their children. It is rather more frightening than its predecessors. Older children should be fine.All in all, Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun is a wonderful novel for children. Adult fans of Proper_Noun will also find a lot to enjoy in it. (Note: Proper_Noun attention to the characters\' names. There are hints hidden within them!). This Proper_Noun and the series as a whole are highly recommended.
