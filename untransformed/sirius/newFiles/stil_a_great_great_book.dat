15Harry does not live in a sun dappled, happy world that seems to have invaded children\'s fiction of late. His classmates are not all model perfect, his clothes don\'t come from the Proper_Noun In fact, Proper_Noun lives in a world of danger, and excitement, and that is so much more fun. Being 29, I thought I would be briefly amused by these Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books and then move on.Instead, I am a huge Proper_Noun convert and have honestly not been this excited about a series of books in a long time. Not only has Rowling brought back the joy of reading, but she has breathed new life in children\'s fantasy. As a former student in library school, i know full well what will be the popular books for years to come, and deservedly so. For those of you willing to pooh pooh these books and relegate them to the children\'s bin, open these books up and read them. We hear that kids have all the fun..well, hee\'s your second chance! Long live Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun I especially liked the introduction of the Dementors in this book, fearsome beings that can suck all the happiness out fo you. These are among Rowlings most terrifying creations. The rest of the gang is here as well, getting themselves into more trouble than ever.The only bad thing is the wait until the 5th book comes out! Hurry Proper_Noun hurry!
