41Well, as a wrap-up to the series, I have to say Proper_Noun disappointed overall although Proper_Noun had some good points -- her battle scenes were exciting. Bad points -- plot and character resolutions. I listed all the deaths of the Proper_Noun of the Proper_Noun vs. Death Proper_Noun and I was shocked to say the least at the body count; what was Proper_Noun thinking? Totally Proper_Noun -- several deaths which I will not name here to keep from spoiling for those who haven\'t read it yet; ruined my enjoyment, and my respect for her as an author plummeted. I agree with many other reviewers who say Proper_Noun rushed through writing this book. Either that, or she did not think it through, it didn\'t fit at all with the previous six at all. Last but not least, the Proper_Noun cheesy from a fiction standpoint, necessary for the poor kids who expected a better ending. I would gladly have waited for a superior 5-star Proper_Noun 7.
