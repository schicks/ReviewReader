26With the fourth book about to come out and the first three staying in the top ten on all best seller lists, I thought it was high time that I read the series to find out what makes it so popular. Besides, my wife and my ten year old son love the stories.I discovered that Proper_Noun K. Rowling has a wonderful writing style. Although the stories build upon themselves they can be read independently as she reviews aspects from the past. She creates very interesting characters. We admire Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and his friends Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun We despise Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun muggle relatives. The characters that start out as villians may turn out to be heroes. All the plots are intriguing and magic is brought in to help the plot.This is the longest and best of the three. In fact I think each book is better than its predecessor. They are all great!In this one it is Proper_Noun secret that leads to the surprise ending and helps Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun save Proper_Noun Proper_Noun and Proper_Noun but also Proper_Noun Pettigrew\'s escape seems to be a lead in for book 4 where I suspect he will return to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun are seven books in the series and most nhave now come out as movies as well. Starting with the Proper_Noun of Proper_Noun the books became a little too long and "dark" for the youth groups that it was originally intended for. Rowling has a way of attracting both the children and the adults to these books. Still I became disappointed with some of the latter ones.
