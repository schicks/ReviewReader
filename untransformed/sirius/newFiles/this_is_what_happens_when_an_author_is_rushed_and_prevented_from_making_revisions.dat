45I\'ve read every one of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun books and, unlike a few other reviewers, am of the opinion that they got progressively better. Books 5 &amp; 6 were my favorites, and I looked forward to seeing how Proper_Noun would conclude this brilliant series.Unfortunately, Proper_Noun 7 reads like she didn\'t conclude the series at all, but rather scribbled an outline, typed a few sample chapters, and had the bulk of the volume ghostwritten. It really was that bad. If Proper_Noun did, indeed, write "Deathly Proper_Noun in its entirety, her heart certainly wasn\'t in it. It reads like a hurried revision of a first draft that was never edited, developed, or polished. Someone Proper_Noun this Proper_Noun to be published by a set deadline: and it shows.Before I criticize this book, I want to comment on something I noted in several other negative reviews: some Proper_Noun readers seem to be under the mistaken impression that this is a series of Proper_Noun books." It is not. These books are clearly directed towards Proper_Noun Proper_Noun Proper_Noun as their vocabulary, complexity, and length attest. I am somewhat disgusted with these reviewers complaining because: someone got killed, someone got kissed, or someone yelled a nasty word (Think of the children!). If you take a look at other Proper_Noun Proper_Noun literature, you\'ll soon discover that the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun series is quite tame, and these rare occurrences are not added gratuitously but are integral to the plot. These books are not for little kids (who neither able to fully comprehend or appreciate them) -- that\'s who the movies are for.I\'m not going to pick apart the manuscript as so many other reviewers have. If you want an in depth analysis, check out the 2 and 3 star reviews. All Proper_Noun say is melodrama and Proper_Noun ex machina abounds, the author\'s voice seems disinterested, the climactic fight scene is dull and predictable, and about 250 pages is devoted to Proper_Noun Proper_Noun self-pity during a bout of depression. I felt cheated out of a proper end to this fine series. Just because Proper_Noun is apparently sick of the Proper_Noun Proper_Noun phenomenon," was under a strict deadline, and knew that whatever she wrote for Proper_Noun 7 would be a guaranteed bestseller is no excuse to slack off and give her readers a contrived and hollow Proper_Noun cannot entirely place the blame for this on Proper_Noun Proper_Noun though. I\'m certain she was under a great deal of pressure to have this finished by a set date, so as to coincide with the release of a new Proper_Noun Proper_Noun film and boatloads of promotional rubbish. It is impossible to explain to the suits that creative literature cannot be rushed! If Proper_Noun was given another year to get feedback from first-readers and make additional revisions, this could\'ve been a great book. Sadly, that was not the case. Unlikely as it may seem, I do hope that one day Proper_Noun rewrites "Deathly Proper_Noun to make it a fitting conclusion to this legendary series.
