The 37-year-old Harry Potter fan that I am, I know I am not JKR\'s target audience. That said, I was disappointed by some of this installment\'s contrivances, repetition, and lack of smart and witty dialog. For example, some of the clues Harry, Ron, and Hermione seek just sort of appear out of nowhere, causing this reader to pause and raise an eyebrow, and more than a couple battles conclude with Harry regaining consciousness, having blacked out at the end. However these disappointments did not stop me from inhaling the book; I was definitely hooked. The battle cry of Dumbledore\'s Army was chilling and exhilarating, and the final show down pretty satisfying, too. One thing though:  did an editorial assistant write the epilogue? Seriously?
