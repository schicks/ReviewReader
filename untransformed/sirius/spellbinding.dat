I\'m a teacher so I decided to read Harry Potter &amp; the Scorcerer\'s Stone to see what all the hoop-lah is about.  After reading all three of her Harry Potter novels, it\'s easy to see how Rowling\'s fascinating books made it to the New York Times Bestseller List and why they are the favorite  of children AND adults everywhere!  Rowling has done a cosmic job creating  Harry, as well as the various other young wizards and witches of the  Hogwarts School.  The reader can almost feel the sensation as Harry and Ron  vanish through the wall to get to platform nine and three-quarters, feel  the tickle as a young wizard accidentally walks through Nearly-Headless  Nick (one of the many ghosts that resides in Hogwarts), feel the thrill as  Harry leads his team to victory in Quidditch, or feel the numbing cold as  you-know-who makes an appearance or the dementors come walking by.  Peaked  your curiousity?  I would recommend this book to any parent and child  looking for a fun, intellectually-stimulating, imaginative book to read!
