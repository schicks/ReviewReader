Every Once in a while, a book comes along that spellbinds millions. Like The Hobbit, You certainly know Bilbo Baggins, and you know all about Tolkien. A new book has come, Harry Potter. I love this book. I enhale all  of the information exhales. Please say my vote was helpful. I am 82 years  old and nothing would please me more than to be a top reviewer.
