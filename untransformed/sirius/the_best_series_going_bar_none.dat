I must admit I was a bit skeptical about all the hype over the Harry Potter books. How could any book live up to all those superlatives? But by the time I\'d finished the first chapter of Book 1, I was a believer. These  books truly have something for everyone: magic, fantasy, wonderful  characters who never turn into stereotypes, and best of all a young hero  who continually risks his own life to save his friends. Rowling\'s superb  writing and vivid imagination make us care about Harry Potter. Far from  being a corrupting influence, I find the books uplifting and highly moral.  Good (i.e. Harry) always triumphs over evil, although not without a fight.  If the books are sometimes dark, well, so is real life. In my opinion we  could all do a lot worse than to emulate Harry Potter\'s many fine  qualities.
