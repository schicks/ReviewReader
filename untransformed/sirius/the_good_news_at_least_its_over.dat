I tried to read this book with as non-prejudicial an eye as I could possibly read. Honestly. I adored her first three books, absolutely hated her work from Book 4 through 6 and I really hoped that this would be better.To be fair to Rowling, she did tie up many loose ends from the earlier books, and actually provided a decent finish to the series that seemed to satisfy all parties. The Dark Lord died, and Harry and his friends survive mostly unscathed.However, the sins of her previous work came back to haunt this book too, as many of the loose ends created were unnecessary, and resulted in another book of gargantuan proportions that really meandered to nowhere too often, and could not be read by itself (a hallmark of bad series writing).The book, started badly with a needless description of Voldemort\'s activities, but Rowling redeemed herself with a thrilling description of a chase from Harry\'s house to Tonk\'s. From then on it was largely about Harry, Hermione and Ron wandering about the countryside of Great Britain looking for Horcruxes and trying not to get killed. It culminates in a thrilling standoff at Hogwarts, death of many characters we have known to love and finally the death of Voldemort himself.But this book felt as bad as the rest for me. For one, her woeful underutilisation of characters made it a very one dimensional story of the three kids vs. Voldemort, and everything else it seemed was almost meaningless. Characters apart from Harry, Ron, Hermione and Voldemort seemed to just be bit-players of almost ridiculously insignificant roles (Contrast this with the way Tolkien used his characters in the Lord of the Rings). The plot, characterisations, and roles each of the protagonists played was hilariously simplistic, to the point of absurdity and with all the interesting characters all dead by the time this book was released, it meant that she had to devise very convoluted means to still keep them relevant and thus the story, interesting (including a meeting with a very deceased Dumbledore and a flayed baby (I wish I was making this up) at King\'s Cross station).After portraying Dumbledore as a trusting old fool who was probably senile and/or insane upto and including Book 6, Rowling, in her attempt to round out his character better just ended up making him appear like a conniving, senile, insane trusting old fool at the end of this book.What was perhaps most perplexing was Rowling seemed to have a penchant for killing off characters for no apparent reason in duels and conflicts that really go nowhere. After making readers feel for and emotionally reach out to Lupin, Dobby and (to a lesser extent) Fred and Moody, she killed them off in almost cavalier fashion, like they were just people who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They could have been Harry\'s dead parents for all the role they played in this last book.Rowling\'s definition of a work for young adults seems to rely exclusively on introducing copious amounts of death and lots of \'snogging\'. Her work has all the sophistry of a childrens\' book and unintentionally hilarious accounts of teenage romance and angst (which makes one cast a doubt whether Rowling actually went through a normal teenage life), resulting in a piece of work that is too childish, one-dimensional and simple for grown-ups, and too unpleasant for children. As I asked before, could we have the \'Prisoner of Azkaban\' Rowling back, please?
