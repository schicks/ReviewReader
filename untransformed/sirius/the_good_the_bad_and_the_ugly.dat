Well, as a wrap-up to the series, I have to say I\'m disappointed overall although JKR had some good points -- her battle scenes were exciting. Bad points -- plot and character resolutions. I listed all the deaths of the Order of the Phoenix vs. Death Eaters, and I was shocked to say the least at the body count; what was JKR thinking? Totally UGLY -- several deaths which I will not name here to keep from spoiling for those who haven\'t read it yet; ruined my enjoyment, and my respect for her as an author plummeted. I agree with many other reviewers who say JKR rushed through writing this book. Either that, or she did not think it through, it didn\'t fit at all with the previous six at all. Last but not least, the EPILOGUE: cheesy from a fiction standpoint, necessary for the poor kids who expected a better ending. I would gladly have waited for a superior 5-star Book 7.
