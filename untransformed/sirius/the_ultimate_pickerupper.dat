Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite of the current three books. It takes people deeper into the wizarding realm, with secret passages, a magic map (a very amusing touch, that!), revealed secrets, and  a look at what prejudice does to people who are different because of forces  beyond their power to control. More truth about Harry\'s past makes his life  itself seem ever more mysterious (and from the number of reviews, here, a  lot of people like mysteries!) He makes new friends, breaks more old rules,  and learns about the strength that lies within himself. But the book ends  with a cliffhanger: Where did Sirius Black and Buckbeak go? Will we see  them again? Will we see Lupin again? (I hope so!) What will happen to Lupin  now? Who will the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher be? Black,  Lupin, and Buckbeak could be great allies for Harry and his friends later  on. The story itelf made me laugh \'til my sides ached (due to the antics of  Ron Weasley\'s brothers), tremble with fear (at the dementors and what they  represent), cheer with triumph (due to the outcome of the final Quiddich  match), and had me on the edge of my seat reading as fast as possible to  find out what happens next. I came away from this one grinning just as  broadly as I had with the last two.My little sister introduced me to the  Harry Potter books last year. I had been searching for something new in the  fantasy genre for a while, but I never thought I\'d find what I was looking  for in a children\'s book. I found myself sympathising with Harry (as a  teenage child, myself, from a straight-laced family). Hogwarts sounded like  the ideal school- I, and all my friends who\'ve read the books, all want to  go there. The adventures swept me away, helping me to temporarily forget  the stresses of reality.I would like to put in a few words of thanks  and gratitude to J.K. Rowling. I recently suffered from a combination of  overwhelming depression, and an intense fear of nothing tangible. Not a  very pleasant experience, mind you. Reading about Harry Potter saved my  sanity and my grades.I would also like to put in a few words of disgust  to the people who feel the books support Satanism. They\'ve obviously not  got their heads screwed on tight enough. Catholic priests read these to  their children as bedtime stories, or hadn\'t you read the newspaper lately?  And as a Witch myself, I can vouch for the fact that these books do not  promote WitchCraft in the slightest. They promote a renewed sense of wonder  and fascination in a world that has become jaded and weary. If the magic in  the series is to be condemned, then so should art, and music, which, as  Dumbledore says, is "a magic beyond what we do" at Hogwarts.
