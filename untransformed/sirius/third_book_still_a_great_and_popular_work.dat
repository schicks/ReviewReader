With the fourth book about to come out and the first three staying in the top ten on all best seller lists, I thought it was high time that I read the series to find out what makes it so popular. Besides, my wife and my ten year old son love the stories.I discovered that J. K. Rowling has a wonderful writing style. Although the stories build upon themselves they can be read independently as she reviews aspects from the past. She creates very interesting characters. We admire Harry Potter and his friends Hermoine and Ron. We despise Malfoy and Harry\'s muggle relatives. The characters that start out as villians may turn out to be heroes. All the plots are intriguing and magic is brought in to help the plot.This is the longest and best of the three. In fact I think each book is better than its predecessor. They are all great!In this one it is Hermoine\'s secret that leads to the surprise ending and helps Hermoine and Harry save Sirius Black and Buckbeak but also Pettigrew. Pettigrew\'s escape seems to be a lead in for book 4 where I suspect he will return to Lord Voldemort.There are seven books in the series and most nhave now come out as movies as well.  Starting with the Goblet of Fire the books became a little too long and "dark" for the youth groups that it was originally intended for.  Rowling has a way of attracting both the children and the adults to these books.  Still I became disappointed with some of the latter ones.
