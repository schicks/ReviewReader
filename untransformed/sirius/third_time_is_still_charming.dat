This may be the best Harry Potter so far! Not since C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien has a fantasy/adventure series of this quality shown such consistency! Rowlings never lets you down. Her characters are real, her settings are absorbing, her plots are remarkably well constructed. The  mystery and suspense of The Prisoner of Azkaban are as riveting as the  first two Harry Potter books. The expert weaving of the past, present, and  future of Harry and indeed the whole wizarding community presents a  tapestry of depth and complexity that is positively a joy to me. I was  expecting some resolutions that didn\'t come, which can only mean one thing:  THERE\'S MORE HARRY POTTER ON THE WAY!  AND I CAN\'T WAIT!
