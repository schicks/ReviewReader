With a plot that doesn\'t go anywhere for most of the book J.K. Rowling has managed to completely bore me with her final installment of the Harry Potter series.  I was completely prepared to love this book, I waited in line twice (once in the morning for a bracelet and again in the evening for the book) and spent hours discussing what was going to happen with friends, so I was completely unprepared for the dull slog that was book 7.I couldn\'t believe that the story relied on Voldemort, supposedly a smart and talented wizard, completely forgetting that he and Harry had an attachment and accidentally showing Harry where all the horcruxes were!  Apparently the email about how to survive as an evil overlord never got to Voldemort, because I\'m pretty sure the "don\'t reveal the locations of your secret life sources to the good guys, no matter how much you think you\'ve got them beat" was one of the items.  Come on!!!Really the only good thing I can say about this book is that I don\'t have to wait for a sequel, but if there was one I don\'t think I would buy it anyway.
