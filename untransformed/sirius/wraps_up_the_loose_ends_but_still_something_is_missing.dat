This book must have been a challenge to write. How to make it compelling in its own right while also wrapping up all the plot lines that have been thrown out in previous books? I think Rowling does a fabulous job of bringing many things to a close, but she\'s done so in a somewhat haphazard manner. For instance, while any of the other books in the series could stand alone for new readers, someone who hasn\'t read the previous books would be totally lost. And the plot does a lot of drifting from here to there with no clear path, which made it much less exciting than previous books. I also hated to see some of my favorite characters meet their end -- so sad!All in all, though, this book ends well, with the same excitement and intrigue that characterized the rest of the series. Well done, J.K.!PS What happened to Luna???
