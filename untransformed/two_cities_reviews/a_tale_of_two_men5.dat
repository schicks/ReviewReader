A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a chronical of the lives of the aristocracy and the lower class through the times leading up to and during the French Revolution.  It Is a tale of both London and Paris, but I found that the real story happens in the latter of the two.  The theme of two\'s is used frequently throughout the story.  There are people living double lives-going by secret names.  The story shows both sides of the French Revolution; It shows the lives of the rich and poor.  The theme of being resurrected and being condemned to death go hand in hand throughout the story.  The main theme, that also has two sides, is that of love and hatred.  I saw the powers of hatred break apart families and condemn men\'s lives; I saw the power of love ultimately defeat hatred and restore those condemned lives.  I really did enjoy reading this book. It touches very deeply on the the victory of love and how love can change.  It is a story of change.  I didn\'t think I would enjoy it when I first started reading the book, but it hooked me and changed the way I felt.  It is right around 400 pages, and there are footnotes to help in the understanding of the history of the story.
