By the year 2006, can Dickens\' novel A Tale of Two Cities still hold relevance? The answer is a simple yes. It is a great tale of how love, revolution, and chaos can all fall into place at the same moment. But the most interesting topic that he addresses is the theme of rebirth or revolution. This rebirth is not only that of France, but of Dr. Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carton. All of them are changed by the events happening during the time of the novel. They reshape their ideals, reintroduce themselves into the world, reinvent themselves, and revitalize their spirits. That is way resurrection is the most noticeable subject in this novel. France is about to undergo the bloodiest revolutions that Europe has ever seen. The peasants of France revolt in hopes creating a government that will take care of their needs. They have little food and the food that they do have is rotten. Dickens does an absolutely amazing job of describing the peasants\' awful situation. However, he only depicts the tragic peasants with only a negative depiction of the aristocrats. A great example of this is the way in which he descries Monseigneur\'s massive house and he\'s chocolate eating, "Monseigneur, on of the great lords...he must have died of two. (122-123)" This is a very critical view of a man with power because it never shows another side to him. This implies that he is always greedy and only looks after himself. Another bias view of the wealthy is seen in Marquis. Who is shown as a selfish, non-sympathetic man who gets what he deserves, death. "It is extraordinary... The horses there: are they right? (129-130)" With no positive view of an aristocrat, it is impossible to make a fair judgment about the rich, or the poor. Dickens goal is to justify a revolution based on poor character of the rich ruling class. He succeeds in doing so at the cost of the aristocrats of France. The most obvious character to undergo change is Dr. Manette. As the very first chapters show, he is "recalled to life. (14)" in the course of the novel. In the literal since, he is taken out of a wrongful imprisonment of 18 years with no contact with the outside world. But on a much deeper level however, the book focuses on how he comes back into the world. He transforms from a weak, feeble shoemaker to a strong character that\'s able to control crowds and lead them towards the greater-good. The only fault in this complete change is that he does occasionally go back to his old ways in making shoes when he becomes depressed. But these episodes are too brief to change the fact that Manette has a complete turn around from who he is at the beginning of the novel to the end. Charles Darnay also exemplifies a person who recreates himself in order to use the second chances he gets in life. Born into wealth, he sees the maltreatment that the rich shows towards the poor. That is why he revokes his power and rights in order to live a regular life. But after he is nearly sent to jail in England he reinvents himself as a lover as he falls in love with Lucie. However when the opportunity comes for him to save the day, he puts on his hero cape and goes back to France. Again he is arrested, but this time his life is in jeopardy has he faces the gallows. And only help from Carton is he saved from the clutches of death. Sydney Carton is the most interesting characters in the novel because of the drastic changes that he undergoes. Dickens shows Carton as a worthless drunk with no future "Sydney Carton, idlest... that humble capacity (102)". As time goes on, he falls in love with Lucie but doesn\'t allow his feelings to interfere with her life. That is until Darnay\'s life is in danger. Carton gives up his life in place of Darnay. This clearly shows that he makes a major change in his character. This change happens because he wants to make up for the wasted life that he has lived by sacrificing himself to save another. This brings about a sense of peace in him that he has never felt "It is a far... I have ever known (443)" With so much change and unstableness going on in the novel, it is easy to understand why the country and the fore mentioned characters of Manette, Darnay, and Carton undergo such dynamic shifts in their personas. France has its revolutions, Manette is recalled to life, Darnay is reborn twice, and Carton is resurrected as a hero and martyr. That kind of writing leads me to the conclusion that life is all about second chances and renewal. This was Dickens\' purpose in writing a novel like this, and that is why A Tale of Two Cities is a book that stands out amongst the greatest literary pieces of all time.
