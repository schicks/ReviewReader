I did not know this was an abridged edition until I ordered it. I never read abridged editions. I deleted it from my Kindle. I still have a lot to learn. I love Charles Dickens, and had already read this book many years ago. I was looking forward to rereading it. Now I have to order another one, and I will certainly be more careful this time.
