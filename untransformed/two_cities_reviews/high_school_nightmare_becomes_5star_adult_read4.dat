Now that I\'m a very well-read adult, I look back in amazement at some of the books assigned to me in high school. Before I had too many books under my belt they threw this one at me. AND Moby Dick and several other incomprehensible (for a surfing kid from L.A.) selections. I simply didn\'t read them. I\'d get a few pages in and my eyelids would head south. Or one of my friends would come over. Then I\'d pick up the Cliff notes which was even MORE boring.Looking back, I don\'t think the teachers or whoever developed the reading curriculum knew what they were doing. After all, I have a PASSIONATE love of books now, and these people simply turned me off completely to reading.But anyway, despite the precocious braggadocio of several Tween reviewers here, this isn\'t a "beginner\'s" book for several important reasons. Most importantly the language is dated and it takes lots of extra work and rereading of passages to get the gist of them. Secondly, the narrative can be plodding with philosophical, historical, geographical, botanical and meteorological expatiations that could zap the attention span of any reader, much less one with raging hormones and skateboards to ride.But now that I\'ve read the book on my own terms I can say unequivocally, that it\'s a masterpiece. From the amazing characters, the exciting pace of the action, the weaving of story threads, the suspense, the horror, the surprise twists and turns, and the great humor, Dickens leaves no doubt that he is one of the greatest storytellers in history. The way he captures the atmosphere, mannerisms, sights, smells, emotions, indulgences and despairs of the people and places in the book is nothing short of remarkable, even miraculous. It\'s hard to pick up another book after a great one by Dickens.
