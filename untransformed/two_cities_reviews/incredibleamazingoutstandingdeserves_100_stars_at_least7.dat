This is an extraordinary book!But,it isn\'t surprising,after all it\'s Dickens.This book starts a little vaguely at first so it\'s hard to understand what\'s going on.Some might stop reading at this point-DON\'T DO  THAT!The book starts a few years before the French revolution and the story  accelerates with every page,until it reaches the revolution itself.It tells  the story of a few people that are strangers to each other at first but  their destinies become entwined later on.I learned a lot about the French  revolution at school,saw many movies,but nothing made me understand it  better than this book!Dickens manages to put you right in the middle of  it.You feel as if you see it with your own eyes,as if you experience it  yourself.Dickens also does another amazing thing-he doesn\'t take sides!he  describes the horrors of the aristocracy towards the common people to  explain why the revolution took place but,he also describes the great  horror of the revolution and what happens when anarchy and chaos take  control.He shows how people become complete beasts and loose every trace of  humanity,how insignificant life can become.The ending of the book is a  great peace of literary work even though it\'s not very realistic ,it\'s  still amasing.I recommend this book to everybody.
