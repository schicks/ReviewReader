I was first introduced to this book when I was 14 years old in my 8th grade English class.  I found it utterly overwhelming; in its cast, its plotlines, its settings, its themes and most of all, in the intricate web the various relationships create.  I only understood three things about this book.  First, the two cities are London and Paris.  Second, France was convulsing itself with the French Revolution while England was undergoing changes that would prepare it to enter the Industrial Revolution.  Third, English in Dickens\' time did not resemble English at the end of the 20th century, but somehow seemed similar to the English used in Hollywood epic movies from the 1950s and 1960s like Spartacus, Ben-hur, the Ten Commandments, Cleopatra, etc...Years later, I picked up this book and reread it.  I considered this a labor, not of love, but of duty.  This book is so famous and used so often in English literature classes that I felt I had to read it again for a deeper understanding.  What I got from this book a 2nd time around is a profoundly subtle yet accurate sociological and psychological study of what happens to a society and a community that is built on shaky foundations.  Specifically, France was an aristocracy where a tiny minority owned all the land.  The rest of society was organized into tiers that varied in their opportunities of becoming landowners.  Because of this pyramid structure, most of the people hewed to the social order knowing that yes they get crapped on by those above them, but there\'s always somebody below them to take advantage of.Eventually this social Ponzi scheme comes to a screeching halt with the French Revolution.  Enough people have had enough that they decide to start over.  In the process a lot of people get killed and a lot of property changes hands.  So woven into this story of a society\'s collapse are individual tales of woe, revenge, sacrifice, retribution, love and lust.  Some are wrongly imprisoned or executed, while others willingly trade places to free those who have been marked for punishment.  Families are torn asunder, and friendships are made and betrayed.Overall, this book is a classic; though not appropriate for anyone not in their mid-teens yet.  Its careful depiction of a society warrants its reading for those interested in 18th century Western history.  But it should be read with notes and study guides for its depth and complexity can easily lose the interest and focus of many readers.
