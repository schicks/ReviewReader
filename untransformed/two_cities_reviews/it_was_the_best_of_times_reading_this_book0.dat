Love, betrayal, drama, and suspense, the makers of a great novel, are all found in Charles Dickens\', A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens not only sets a great foundation for the novel but he also builds an illustrious story with great detail. His creativity explodes in this book.  The book is set in  the time before and during the French Revolution. It is about the  experiences of two French families and how those experiences later collide  with their future. Their experiences not only create a great fictional  story but they also dipict the true horrors that occured in France at that  time.  Dickens makes the plot very interesting because he incorporates  fiction and historical facts and events. For example in the storming of the  Bastille scene, he brings to life an actual event and adds the fiction of  what the peasants found in Dr. Manette\'s cell and the inside look on how  they may have felt. Two other examples include the scenes where the  revolutionaries kill the king and queen of France and the many times they  use the guillotine. They demonstrate this mixture because they\'re true  events yet, Dickens adds fictional characters and the feelings and emotions  the people might have had.  Another great touch that Dickens adds is all  the detail. Although at times it is rather long it helps to make a clear  picture in the mind of what is going on. One such example where he does  this is when he describes fate and death. He makes two rather hard to  picture objects visible in the mind as the Farmer and the Woodsman. Another  example of his great use of detail is when he describes Mr. Lorry\'s trip  down the Dover mail. His description gives the feeling of actually being  there. These are just two but there are numerous of other examples.  One  more thing that made this novel fascinating was how Dickens reveals bits  and pieces of the plot mixed together, but then ties every piece together  at the end. For example he dipicts the Marquis\' cruelness first and does  not explain his involvement right away. However, by the end he turns out to  be a key character. He also does that with the character of Dr. Manette. He  introduces the character but leaves the suspense of that character\'s  involvement until later. The suspense keeps the interest in the novel  going.  Dickens details, mixture of fact with fiction, and suspense  makes the novel a extremely enjoyable book. After reading this book a clear  understanding is achieved of why Charles Dickens is such a renowned author.  A Tale of Two Cities is a unique and fascinating story which is why it is a  must for anyone\'s bookself.
