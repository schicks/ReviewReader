There is so much to say about A Tale of Two Cities that one hardly knows where to begin.  The scene of our book is the French Revolution.  It is a time in history when the french peasants, horrifically treated by the nobility, revolted and caused what is known as \'the terrors\'.  It is a time when people can be accused in secret, tried summarily, and then tortured and beheaded.  Many, many people were beheaded on a daily basis, sixty, or more, at a time.A Tale of Two Cities takes this story up by beginning with the story of Dr. Manette, who has spent fifteen years as a secret prisoner in a tower of the Bastille.  He is rescued by an old servant, Monsieur Defarge, who turns him over to his daughter Lucie.  Lucie, who has always thought her father dead, takes care of her mentally damaged father and helps restore him to his health and sanity.We also meet Charles Darnay, who Lucie eventually comes to love  and marry.  Turns out, unfortunately, that Charles is actually living in England under and assumed name, because he is really a french nobleman, much hated in his mother country.  When Charles is called back to Paris to clear the name of an old servant he is imprisoned.  Much of the story is then spent in the effort to get Charles out of prison, and his family safely out of Paris.The story is too complicated and wonderfully intricate to describe in full here.  There are many other characters which are all important.  For those who loves suspence, A Tale of Two Cities holds many surprises and will keep you wondering the entire time.  There are loves unrequitted, acts of horror, deep sadnesses, and acts of perfect heroism.  This story will bring tears to your eyes.As a piece of literature, A Tale of Two Cities is unsurpassed.  The writing is beautiful!  This book begins and ends with two of the most famous lines in all of literature.  The words are truely poetic.  The prose is full, deep, and perfectly moody.  Dickens does an excellent job of painting not just the scenes for us, but the feel of the time.  He makes you experience the weight of the drudgery the peasants experienced, the horror of the terrors, the grief of the mourner, and the triumph of the human spirit.  Read this book, you cannot be disappointed.
