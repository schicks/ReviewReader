I tried the free edition, I tried this $0.99 premium edition, and I tried the Cambridge World Classics edition. They have the same punctuation errors. It appears they just repackaged this edition from another digital edition.Example of correct punctuation from a Signet Classic printed edition:"A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived was not to be found in London."Example of incorrect punctuation from the three digital editions I tried:"A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London."These errors are numerous and they jolt my mind. I\'ll be searching for another edition without them. If they don\'t bother you, save your money and stay with the free edition.
