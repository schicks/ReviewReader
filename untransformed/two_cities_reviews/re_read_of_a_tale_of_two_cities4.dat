I studied this book in great detail while preparing for my GCE exams many years ago.  However, re-reading it was quite a different experience, an eye opener for the mature reader.  Now I am able to appreciate Dickens\' writing far more and I shall certainly re-read more of his books.  The details of the French Revolution were very educational and scarey in the sense that the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in France at the time of the Revolution still exist in many parts of the world today.  It is a story of courage in the midst of chaos and distrust. It is also interwoven with love between father and daughter, husband and wife and, unforgettably, Sidney Carton\'s for the heroine.A Tale of Two Cities is a book than can be read several times and still give renewed pleasure.
