The beginning was great but the ending was AMAZING. So much suspense, and the outcome really was unpredictable. Most of the characters were really well drawn. And Dickens is always good at getting the reader into his setting, which in this case was creepy and fascinating. He also does an awesome job of good vs. evil in all his books, and this was no exception.The main downside was that the middle part was slow, but the ending was totally worth it.
