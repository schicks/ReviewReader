I\'m thirty-seven years old, and now I read Dickens. I didn\'t read this book in high school, and didn\'t go to college. That I\'ve read it now, and not twenty years ago, is for me due course; I\'m a strange one who believes in a time for every book.What strikes me deepest, besides the unashamed redemption in this book--something Dickens would not get away with in this day--is the power of truth in fiction. The power of parable. This is a book I will ply to my fact-lovin\' friends; I will read what they say to get them to read this. Like no other book I\'ve read, "A Tale of Two Cities" will show them the power of story as truth.It\'s a far, far better tale than I have read in a long, long while.
