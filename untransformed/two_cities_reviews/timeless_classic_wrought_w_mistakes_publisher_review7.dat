The back cover does not match "look inside" picture - I received a condensed version of Dickens\' story consisting only of train/mistress story.  Last line:  "His affair with Nellly eventually cost his his marriage."  Their typos, not mine.Title heading on every page inside reads "A Tail of Two Cities."  Once again, their mistake (spelling), not mine.So what else is wrong with this printing?  I don\'t know this book well enough to risk finding out...Also there is no publishing page in the book - is this a legal copy?
