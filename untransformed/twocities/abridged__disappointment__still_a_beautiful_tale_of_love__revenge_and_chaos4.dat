This ebook is an abridged version . It was such a disappointment that they have not mentioned it anywhere. Just 238 pages ....! uh ...A Tale of Two Cities is a great novel which is beautiful in so many ways. From its gorgeous language ( which is quite hard to interpret for many people ) to its lovable main character Sydney Carton, this is truly an epic story best enjoyed by mature and appreciative readers..Buyer BEWARE . Do not order this copy of ebook because its an abridged version ! Buy the full version and you would be happy to read it ... Classic !!
