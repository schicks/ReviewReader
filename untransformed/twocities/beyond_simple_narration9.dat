I read the one-star review and was hesitant to purchase this product, but the price was compelling enough, and I bought it. I have been pleasantly surprised by it\'s quality.The narrator is Frederick Davidson (1932-2005). His back-of-box bio reads: "He was born in London, trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and performed in BBC radio plays before coming to America in 1976." He has earned multiple awards, including the Golden Voice Award, numerous AudioFile Earphone Awards, and a Grammy nomination for his readings. His reading of this novel goes beyond simple narration, as opposed to the monotonous readings of other narrators of other audiobooks.  He immerses himself into the reading and assigns various tonal qualities &amp; vocal patterns for the various characters, including French and British accents. It is a dramatic performance rather than a simple reading.  I continue to find it a delight to listen to while reading my textual copy.As for the one-star rating given before, I cannot understand the comment, "He does not vary his voice sufficiently to make it interesting". The fact that he DOES take on the different roles in unique vocal patterns and rhythms totally contradicts that claim.  Davidson also provides a smooth flow throughout the chapters, providing not just narration, but a dramatic monologue that is reminiscent of Patrick Stewart\'s one-man-show, "A Christmas Carol". I have given it only a four star rating due to some background noise I heard in the various discs. It is not terribly noticeable, but does exist nonetheless.All in all, I\'m pleased with the price and performance.
