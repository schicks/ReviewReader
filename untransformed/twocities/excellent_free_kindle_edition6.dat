Enough has been said about the book itself by others who are far more qualified--this is an excellent read. I\'ll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit-and-miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and  unless you are looking for scholarly commentary, there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative.
