I did not realize that, to avoid being scammed, it was necessary to read a complete description of this product, including customer reviews, before purchasing.  This book, listed as a paperback version of A Tale of Two Cities, is, in fact, a "retelling", I suppose for children!  What an unscrupulous seller! There is an obvious intent to mislead here.  Beware is right!  Don\'t buy from this seller!
