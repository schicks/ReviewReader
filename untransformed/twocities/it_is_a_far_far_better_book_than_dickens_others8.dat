A Tale of Two Cities is the best plotted and most readable of Dickens\' works. Broad in scope, the story spans main character Dr. Alexander Manette\'s lifetime and the English Channel. Dickens portrays London as the opulent center of the civilized world, and Paris, in the throes of the French Revolution, as a cesspool of tortured humanity. The complex tale of love, honor, and courage is woven over the backdrop of this politically charged and culturally polarized time in history.Interestingly, it has been alleged that this book, which is shorter and stylistically different than Dickens\' other books, was not actually written by him. Dickens was a unique character in English literature, being perhaps the first writer to achieve wealth and fame during his lifetime. Some suggest that he either lent his good name to the manuscript of an unknown in a duplicitous scheme to boost sales, secretly sharing the proceeds, or that he flat out stole the story from one of the many hopeful writers who sent him manuscripts for comment. We\'ll probably never know the truth. But it doesn\'t matter who wrote it. That only adds to the mystique of a fantastic book. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, Author of Wake Up Dead.
