It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. This is the opening famous line of A Tale of Two Cities. This opening sentence sets up a story of love, life,  friendship, and equality for the French citizens. This book  had a wonderful story line that brings many people together after setting  the reader up to believe they will never find out how these people connect.  The stories main character is Dr. Manette, he is the single character that  brings all of the others together. Based during the French Revolution, we  find out that Dr. Manette was a prisoner of the bastille for 18 years,  which later in the story gives him great authority over the French  citizens. His daughter, Lucie, is the golden hair girl that catches the  heart of all the men she meets. Her devotion to her husband, Charles  Darnay, brings her great sadness when he is imprisoned for his secret life  of being a French noble.  Darnay\'s family was the one that put Dr. Manette  in jail, and took the life of two innocent people, leaving a lonely woman  to fend for herself. She is Madame Defarge, who throughout the entire story  is trying to get Darnay and his family put to death by the guillotine.  After Darnay is sentenced to death only one man can save his life. Sydney  Carton, who looks like Darnay, takes his own life so that the love of his  life, Lucie, will be happy. He knows that she will never want him so he  feels the only thing he can give her is happiness. This book was very  enjoyable and exciting. Although it is rather wordy and the beginning seems  to be endless and boring. However,during the second half you learn how  everything ties together. Every chapter is needed in this book and the time  must be taken to read it thourouly to find out the exciting ending. The  dramatic ending gives a sense of saddness and relief all at once. Which is  why A Tale of Two Cities is a great book. Bringing love, friendship, and  the battle for equality during the French Revolution, together suceeds in  making this an excellent book.
